Footnotes
BARB'S BOO made a move three wide on the turn to engage for the lead then continued wide in the lane while pulling clear late. RAZCAL had a perfect
ground saving trip behind the leaders on the rail came through on the inside but was second best. WOLF POND JACK was off very slowly spotting the field
eight lengths settled and was moving best in the lane to be up for third. FEED THE STREAK battled for command on the inside early but tired in the stretch.
MOST NOTORIOUS was three wide on the turn but had no response in the stretch. LAUNCH POINT battled for the lead from the two path but came up
empty in the stretch.
