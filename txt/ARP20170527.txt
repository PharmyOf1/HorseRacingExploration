NOROOMONTHETRUCK made a big move up the backstretch along the rail dropped back a bit then came on again in the stretch for the win in a driving
rainstorm. PROSPECTORS NOTE set the pace along the inside but gave way to the winner while clearly second best. TU SOLO TU was very wide in the
first turn and made a mild bid while never a threat for first or second. JILAS PRINCE attended the pace on the outside but was done after three quarters.
ISPEP was always well back while never a contender.

Footnotes
SHE'S THE MOST broke on top opened upa big mrgin then was geared down to win handily. VANT got the perfect rail trip and was second best. SHE'S A
FANTASY made a sweeping move in the center of the track to be up for third. LADY OF HONOR was forwardly placed on the inside but tired. ORANGE
POPPY was in the two path mid pack buit had no response in the stretch. SWEET SANGRIA showed speed on the insde but had nothing in the stretch.
ROCKIN ROSES was always in the back and never a factor.
