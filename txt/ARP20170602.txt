Footnotes
HOT TUB was quickest early and drew clear while ridden out down the stretch. GOLD FLIGHT was well placed behind the leaders slipped through along the
rail and was clearly second best. CRHOSSGO battled for the lead in the two path early but tired in the stretch. HUSH MY MOUTH raced in the two path on
the turn then came very wide in the stretch while slowly gaining for third. RED RIVER BLUE pressed the pace three deep and had nothing in the stretch.
ARNIE broke with the field but dropped back quickly and was never a factor.

ws no match for the winner. ARTAKSEZ was mid pack after the first quarter then was shuffled back but came on again wide in the stretch. STOLEN
PROPERTY was up close in the two path for the first three quarters and had no rally in the stretch. SAMENDRA quickly went to the rail and moved up along
the inside but had nothing in the stretch. THUNDERCLAP NEWMAN acted up in the starting gate before the start and was in perfect striking position going
into the second turn but came up empty.
