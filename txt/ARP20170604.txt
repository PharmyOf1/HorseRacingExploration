TAO made a mid race move between rivals on the turn to move into contention and was all out to hold on for the win. SHARLYNNE'S ANGEL showed the
best early speed on the rail took a breather on the turn but was headed by the eventual winner and could not reagin the lead. SHE'S A FANTASY loomed
boldly four wide at the top of the stretch but did not mount a winning rally. TEMPTABLE raced along the rail the entire race but had no rally in the stretch.
SWINGEN CHARLIE showed good speed away from the gates while three wide and tired.
