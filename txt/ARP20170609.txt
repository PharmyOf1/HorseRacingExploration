Footnotes
COZY BAR battled for te lead in the two path and proved best in the lane. WILDCAT PARTY was three wide on the turn then drifted out five to six wide at
the top of the lane and could not make up the needed ground. EASY HIT had the perfect ground saving trip the entire race and was up for third. JENNINGS
GIRLS showed good speed along the rail to take the early lead but tired in the stretch. RALPHYMOON loomed boldly at the top of the stretch while three
wide but had nothing in the drive. GONNA GET LUCKY came away awkwardly to fall well behind early and was never a serious factor.

Footnotes
EPIC ELECTORATE loomed up four wide on the turn took the lead mid stretch and held the late challenge of Saintly Aura for the win. SAINTLY AURA
raced four wide on the turn and was moving best at the finish. ESSENCE OF SKY showed good speed while three wide and tired. DURTDOBBR was
widest of all in the lane and closed some. DEE'S LUCK was well back early came four wide on the turn and did not have a big stretch run. ORANGE
THUNDER showed good speed on the inside but was through after the first quarter. FOUR TEN EXPRESS was away well along the inside got pinched
back going into the turn came wide entering the stretch and had little left. LION'S PREY was always well back and never a serious factor. SQUARE UP
shoed good speed in the two path but was eased in the final yards and walked off.
