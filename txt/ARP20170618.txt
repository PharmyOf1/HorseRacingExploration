Footnotes
LADYBUG'S HOLIDAY raced four wide ina five horse speed duel but drew clear handily when asked in the stretch. SWEET SANGRIA was the widest of all
in the speed duel and was clearly second best. ORANGE POPPY was last early came seven to eight wide on the turn and was up for the show. INATOOT
had an inside trip and was up for fourth while never a serious threat for the win. AL'S OKIE GAL was the third out in the speed duel and appeared to come
in a bit putting Lady Of Honor in very tight quarters and then tired. LADY OF HONOR was up close in the speed duel and was forced to check and lost her
position and never could recover. COWGIRLS CAUSE was forced to take up when Lady Of Honor was pinched out in the turn and had no rsponse. ALPINE
DANCER raced wide on the turn and tired.
