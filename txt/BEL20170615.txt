the start and showed the way from the two path until tucked inside into the turn, came under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside
for home and drew clear under a drive to prevail. LADY RULLAH bobbled at the break, recovered to chased just off the inside from just off the pace, came

Footnotes
UNDERCOVER AGENT appeared to get off to a clean get-away, remained in the two path, unhurried making its way along the backstretch, picked up
interest when let out a notch shortly after stepping off the backstretch, shifted into path four during the going from midpoint to the five-sixteenth marker,
moved yet wider for the drive home, ultimately bidding in path six, out-fought several others to poke a head down in front at the furlong marker and shook
free. OPEN BAR underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, was directly alongside DISCREET ENCOUNTER as they turned for home, couldn't overhaul
the winner in the last eighth but outfinished the former for place honors. DISCREET ENCOUNTER chased the pace from the two path, was under a drive
prior to the five-sixteenths pole, was leaning on the second place finisher as they spun into the stretch, straightened away and was outkicked. LIGHTNING
BUZZ was being confidently ridden procuring a prominent position, cut over to the two path, sparred to the outside of PRIMO PENTIMENTO, appeared to
grab the slimmest of leads as the second fraction was being displayed to the public, was still narrowly in front when set down to a full drive at the quarter
pole, tried desperately to protect the top during the ensuing furlong, came under seige from a firing line of rivals by midstretch and succumbed. PRIMO
PENTIMENTO dueled for control from along the inside until midlane before backing away. SPOTTY ZEALOUS put to a brisk hand ride springing forth from
the gate, was out-sprinted by a pair of opponents not being asked for much at the time, made it over to the rail well before arriving at the conclusion of the
backstretch, swung five to six wide into the lane, came up empty going about the lane on an erratic course. BOLD ILLUSION underwent a ground-saving
journey to the quarter pole, failed to respond when placed to a brisk ride from the top of the turn to the three-eighths pole, came up to the quarter pole put to
a protective hold, got eased down the lane en route to securing the final minor slice, then made it off the track without need of outside assistance.

Footnotes
DISCREET SENORITA broke out at the start and was corrected, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got set down
spinning just off the inside for home, tipped out to the three path forcing TEJANA to check a furlong out between foes just as she was beginning to back
away, rallied to get up in the final seventy yards and prevailed kept to task. SUMMER HOUSE established the front and showed the way just off the inside
coming under urging at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive under growing threat from a pair, got collared seventy
yards from home, ran on to secure the place honors safely. RIOT WORTHY chased just off the pace four wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, continued four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors.
MALIBU STACY chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide at the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. TEJANA
prompted the pace three wide under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, cornered three wide into upper stretch, was just in the midst of beginning to
back away when forced to check between foes as DISCREET SENORITA angled out in front at the eighth pole, then tired through to the finish. There was a
Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on DISCREET SENORITA and the incident near the eighth pole before the result stood and the race was
declared official.

Footnotes
KITTY MADDNES raced from off the inside throughout, pursued the front runners two to three wide on the turn, swung into the lane and was given her cue,
took over by the beginning of the final furlong and edged away. WAR CANOE made it over to the rail soon after the break, stayed along the insdie route until
a few jumps remaining on the turn, angled sharply five wide into the lane, straightened away and finished willingly to garner the place. CAP'S VOW came
away one length the slowest of all, sat reserved in the two path during the opennig six furlongs, was taken in hand just before commencing to alter course
into path six from midlane to the sixteenth poie, came home with strong but belated energy en route for show honors. LITTLE MISS AMY remained
forwardly placed after a quick start, attended the leader from the outside, two wide early before gradually shiting more into path three proceeding along the
backstretch, turned for home under a hard drive, failed to claim the front then weakened in the final stages. UNDERTHERAIN broke open the gate, came
away without incident once the field was sent on its way, grabbed command soon afterwards, was towards the inside leading the competition onto the
backstretch, inched to the right making her way from one end of it to the other, carved out the pace positioned in the two path on the far turn, got put to a
drive when put to the test coming to the quarter pole, yielded to the winner before safely through the furlong grounds and backed away. SARATIAGO broke
through the gate, got away well after being re-loaded, was hung out three wide on the second bend, fanned outward six to seven wide during the initial
portion of the stretch, came up empty. COURTLY KITTY stayed along the rail after the break, slipped into the path at the half mile pole, raced between rivals
on the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CHORITE pocketed to the quarter pole, made no headway after moving
to the outside.

Footnotes
BIGKAT AND CAMILLE three to four wide near the rear, remained patiently handled until set down angled seven wide into upper stretch, closed well down
the center of the course to issue a challenge through the final eighth and just got up in the shadow of the wire to score. RECKLESS HUMOR three wide in
pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide at the quarter pole, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home,
dug in and was nailed on the wire and forced to settle for the place honors. AVERY MAEVE four wide in aim of the leader, came under a ride five-sixteenths
from home, swung four wide into upper stretch issuing a challenge for command, rallied to take over a furlong from home, dug in under threat, got headed a
sixteenth out and was outfinished in the very late going while holding for the show honors. HEXAMETER four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a
ride five-sixteenths from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick for the last major share. SAME KINDA CRAZY just off the pace just
off the inside, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, angled three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid before being outfinished in the late
stages. HOPONTHEBUSGUS chased the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
clipped the heels of TIZ TWICE straightened away for home before tipping out to the three path, raced behind foes through the stretch and was never fully

extended. NORTH EIGHT STREET saved ground near the rear, got set down angled four wide at the head of the stretch, offered no response. JERMYN
STREET prompted the pace of TIZ TWICE from the two path under a ride with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide at the quarter pole, weakened in the
stretch. BANTY'S GIRL just off the pace three wide, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, took over command spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was headed nearing the eighth pole, weakened through to the finish. LUNA RISING detached at the tail of the field three
then two wide through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. TIZ TWICE
lightly coaxed showing the way through solid splits along the inside, came under a drive at the five-sixteenths under pressure, got headed near the quarter
pole, swung just off the inside at that station, got clipped behind straightened away by HOPONTHEBUSGUS and tired through to the wire.

Footnotes
GUCCI FACTOR responded to a light hand ride early to establish control, cut the pace, two wide and facing no pressure throughout, took a stroll out into
path four early in ithe stretch, drew out, mildly ridden out at intervals. PIRATE'S TREASURE got steadied swerving in at the start, underwent a
ground-saving journey after being placed on the rail nearing the end of the backstretch, cut the corner under a drive, held for the place. SICILIA MIKE three
wide entering the turn, was sent six wide exiting it, got the show. MR. MASSENA ducked in at the start, departed the backstretch from the four path, never
made its presence felt. BIG RAGU made light contact with MOOSEISLOOSE at the start, went about the turn three wide and having been put to a hard
drive, never made it into a contending position. MOOSEISLOOSE brushed at the start, chased the top one for a half before calling it a day. CLASSI CAT got
guided over to the rail in short order, was taken in hand, unsettled with PIRATE'S TREASURE directly abreast right around the nine-sixteenths marker,
continued to take the inside route for almost six furlongs, was moved out into path seven down the lane to no avail.

Footnotes
BROKEN BORDER just off the pace two then three wide, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
over command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept busy to the end. BAREEQA got bumped at the start by FREE N CLEAR due to
ROCKIN ALLI breaking inwards and was pinched between foes, settled just off the inside at the rear of the field, came under coaxing five-sixteenths out,
angled out eight to nine paths into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to secure the place honors while unable to threaten the winner to the wire.
KHALEESI KAT two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, angled six wide at the quarter pole, offered up a mild
kick to garner the show honors. FREE N CLEAR bumped solidly off stride at the start by ROCKIN ALLI and in turn bumped BAREEQA pinching that foe
back against BARREL OF DREAMS, settled two to three wide near the rear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled seven wide into upper
stretch, improved position for the last major share. BARREL OF DREAMS three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing midway on the far turn,
angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. BONITA SPRINGS tracked the pace along the inside, got set down spinning three wide for
home briefly before paused in behind ROCKIN ALLI as that rival came inwards slightly and leaned on CONQUEST HARDCANDY in tight and steadying
nearing the eighth pole, then offered no response thereafter. FLATTERMEFABULOUS saved ground near the rear, came under urging at the three-eighths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. SUGAR MAGS just off the inside in mid pack, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, angled
five wide at the head of the stretch, weakened. ROCKIN ALLI broke in at the start bumping FREE N CLEAR solidly into BAREEQA and causing the
pressure to pinch back the latter foe between rivals, prompted the pace from the two path under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, swung four wide into
upper stretch, drifted in when weakening nearing the eighth pole placing both BONITA SPRINGS and CONQUEST HARDCANDY in tight along her inside

forcing the pair to steady, then weakened through to the finish. CONQUEST HARDCANDY established the front and showed the way in hand along the
inside through swift splits under some prompting by the aforementioned foe to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
for home under threat from a host, yielded the front and was put in tight getting bumped by BONITA SPRINGS when squeezed in tandem with that foe by
ROCKIN ALLI who drifted in when weakening, was forced to steady out despite backing away anyway and was not persevered with to the finish.

Footnotes
STREET FASHION tracked the runner up from the pocket, had the rider resort to some coaxing on the backstretch, was placed to a vigorous hand ride on
the second bend, angled sharply three wide into the lane, rallied with good energy getting up in the last stride. MARK MY STYLE off to an alert beginning,
took control and slid over to the rail, cut the pace, rated and with GOLD SHIELD in accompaniment out in path two, had ARTIES SILVER MINE add himself
to the pace picture on the far turn, held them off, was let out turning into the stretch, staved off GOLD SHIELD in a duel from upper to midlane, got pounced
upon by another pair in the final stages, and although game to the end, was nipped. HIGHLAND SKY raced from off the inside throughout, was forced to
take the three path on the far turn after being beaten to position by RED RIFLE, got set down a few jumps shy of the quarter pole, swung about five wide
into the lane, kicked into his best deep into the furlong grounds, closed in but came up short. GOLD SHIELD attended the pacesetter from the two path,
undertook the task from between rivals once off the backstrech, was called upon for the drive home, vied with vigour during the next furlong but couldn't go
by, held on well with only the last major check to show for the effort. RED RIFLE made it over to the rail well before arriving at the end of the homestretch,
saw the pilot tap on the brakes while appearing a bit keen early on the backstretch, responded when given some rein and beat HIGHLAND SKY to the two
path nearing the half mile pole, kept watch on the front runners, made it to the quarter pole stuck behind a wall of rivals, got placed to encouragement
nonetheless after stepping into the lane, idled behind opponents, lacking optimal racing clearance, inched its way to the inside in deep stretch, vainly hoping
for an opening that failed to materialize, wound up blocked and taken back in hand for the last seventy yards. ARTIES SILVER MINE strung out three wide
on both turns, joined up with the front runners after departing the backstretch, vied as the widest of a trio, having gotten set down to a drive by the
three-eighths pole, swung approximatley four wide into the lane, wasn't appreciably making headway when pinched in midstretch, failed to regain any
interest.
