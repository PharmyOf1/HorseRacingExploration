Footnotes
LITTLEMISSBUSINESS chased the pace along the inside coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled four wide into upper stretch advancing to
issue a challenge and take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under threat through the final sixteenth and held on to rebuff that rival to the finish.
MAMA JOYCE rushed the gate at the start getting away quickly before settling to chase three wide in range of the leader, came under coaxing midway on
the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to threaten through the final sixteenth but was ultimately repelled at the wire while clear of the rest for the
place honors. WILDCAT BELLE bumped at the break by RANGER LADY who recovered inwards from a bobble, dueled inside of CALL HER KARMA
coming under light coaxing approaching the quarter pole before being set down spinning just off the inside for home, got displaced in tandem with her main
pace rival by the eventual winner nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. CALL HER KARMA dueled from the two path with the
aforementioned foe to her inside put to coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, angled three wide at the head of the stretch continuing to knock heads until
overtaken in concert with her main pace foe nearing the furlong grounds, then weakened through to the finish. RANGER LADY bobbled at the break
recovering inwards and bumping with WILDCAT BELLE, chased just off the inside from just off the pace put to coaxing with three furlongs to run, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. LADY PARADIME four then three wide in pursuit under urging from the five-sixteenths,
continued three to four wide for home, tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SPLASHY RISE tracked leaders along the inside path down the backside, and remained unhurried before being urged approaching the quarterpole, got
taken to outside path to rally, and battle with foe to inside, before getting the bob at the wire. THIS BIRD CAN SING gunned from start and taken along four
wide while closely stalking early leader, took lead at the half and launched a bid turning for home, hooked up with rival to her outside, and fought hard to
wire. IMPAZIBLE WOMAN settled in and unhurried through half mile along three path then set down for drive, and caught tiring foes. POSSE'S PARADISE
settled early and tracked the leaders while in hand, was asked for more approaching the quarter pole, but offered enough to beat two rivals to wire.
STARSHIP ROCKETTE sat patiently while being allowed to trail the field, received mild urging approaching the turn, and was set down for drive, but failed
to sustain a bid. HERE TO THE LEFT wrangled out to early lead but under close pursuit from THIS BIRD CAN SING, was collared by that rival before the
half and failed to sustain run through the late stages and faded.
