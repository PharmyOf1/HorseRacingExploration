Footnotes
COZZY SPRING spurted away three then two wide widening away through the turn, got roused three to four wide into upper stretch, went clear under a
drive and was ridden out to the finish. COOL AS YOU LIKE pinched between foes shortly after the start due to pressure from FROST WISE coming inwards,
chased five to six wide until tucked to the three path into the turn, came under coaxing midway on the bend just off the inside, swung six wide into upper
stretch and improved position for the place honors. FROST WISE came inwards shortly after the start pinching COOL AS YOU LIKE and SKYLER'S LIL
CUTIE against JUMPIN' NANCY, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide for home, weakened in the stretch.
QUICK ON THE DRAW chased five to six wide coming under urging three furlongs from home, floated nine wide into upper stretch, tired. GYPSY JO three
wide in pursuit under a ride from midway on the turn, tired in the stretch. SKYLER'S LIL CUTIE pinched between foes after the start, chased four wide under
urging from the three-eighths, went six wide at the quarter pole, faltered in the drive. JUMPIN' NANCY four wide early on, tucked to the two path
nine-sixteenths from home, altered quickly to the three path to avoid the troubled SMART AND SASSY near the seven-sixteenths, then made no impact.
SMART AND SASSY broke in at the start and was corrected, raced forwardly placed in pursuit just off the inside, took a bad step just inside the half mile
pole bobbling heavily and tossing the rider in the process, was apprehended by outrider after the race, escorted back and walked off under her own power.
There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on SMART AND SASSY in the turn before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
CERISE'S PRINCE had the pilot correct course after breaking towards the outside with his first two steps, went about the chute primarily from the three
path, moved with a nice turn of foot to wrest away the advantage right after the first fraction had been posted on the board, worked out a tuck into the two
path once sufficiently in the clear, continued to show the way, feeling no pressure to speak of, extended the margin during the run around the full bend, spun
into the lane, was almost at the three-sixteenths marker before switched over to stronger handling, began the final furlong still comfortably on top, gave up
chunks of the lead in the final stages but reached the finish line in time to prevail. THREE PERFECTIONS underwent a four wide journey to the quarter pole,
moved out into path seven during the early portion of the stretch, maintaining its status of being the widest of all, straightened away, rallied in tandem with
KANTUNE, beating that one for place honors, needed a tad more of ground though to snatch away the verdict. KANTUNE took the inside route for nearly
three-quarters, swung five wide heading for the three-sixteenths pole, closed in on the winner during the next sixteenth and a bit more mildly urged,
responded when eventually placed to a drive and finished willingly for third. RAPPEL mostly three wide to the head of the stretch, got outfinished. AIR VICE
MARSHAL away the second slowest of all, was taken in hand and tipped out into path two at the head of the backstretch, departed it from the same path,
chased the pace from between rivals, stepped into the stretch, had no rally while wandering towards the middle of the course. BERKS COUNTY off to an
alert beginning, cut over to the inside with the advantage, surrendered to the winner early on the backstretch, sat forwardly placed keeping watch on the
new leader, had the rider resort to brisker and brisker urging after reaching the turn, was under a full drive by the five-sixteenths pole, backed away steadily
once into the stretch. CAPTAIN MOSS strung out four wide on the chute, shifted slighlty closer to the rail afterwards, was through by the three-eighths pole,
then was in hand proceeding down the stretch.

the
WONDERMENT six to seven paths off
five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, drew clear through the final sixteenth to prevail.
ABSATOOTLY chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place
honors. COURT DANCER showed the way from the four path down the backstretch, tucked to the two path nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was displaced nearing the eighth pole, weakened in the late
stages. CLIPTHECOUPONANNIE lunged at the start, chased five wide down the backstretch before tucking to the three path into the turn, came under a
ride midway on the bend, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch backing away and weakened through the stretch. SUPER ALLISON dwelt at the start
conceding eight to nine lengths to the front, raced detached at the tail of the field four wide until tucked to the two path nine-sixteenths from home put to
coaxing, spun just off the inside into upper stretch making up ground through the drive with simply too much to do and ultimately trailed throughout. There
was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on SUPER ALLISON before the race was declared official.
