Footnotes
HELLO MISS rushed to the lead along the inside to set the pressured pace, shook off SWEET EXCURSION leaving the turn and widened. SWEET
EXCURSION chased three wide, was unable to go on with the winner, but fought on to just hold the place. LUSCIOUS LUCY broke slow, was unhurried into
stride, rallied between horses entering the stretch and was just up to earn the show. VAN'S FLYING BABY was close up, settled off of the pace midway
through the turn, drifted out entering the lane and faltered in the drive. WITCHWAYTOTHEARGO settled in the second flight and failed to threaten. BEE
BEE Q showed little.

Footnotes
DANCING AVA was unhurried, made a sweeping move six wide, reeled in the leaders nearing the furlong marker and kicked clear. SASSY AND REGAL
settled in hand, tucked in to save ground, got through and was fully extended to earn the place. WHODATTCAT rushed to the lead, set the pressured pace
three deep, weakened between runners in the final furlong and settled for the minor award. FOR YU MICHELLE was away in good order, vied for the lead
off of the inside, shifted out leaving the turn, but flattened during the drive. TAINTED PAINT was unhurried into stride, finished with a belated improvement
but failed to threaten. BLUE WILLOW was allowed to settle, came five wide but failed to make headway. BOGSIDE failed to respond. ITZPAPALOTL was
close up three wide through the turn and tired. ASPEN DANCER showed brief foot inside but stopped before going a half.

CEEJAY'S MISTER shook clear to dictate terms, widened into the stretch, was kept to task and held sway. HOLLYWOOD TALENT tracked the pace four
wide under a snug hold, kicked on when put to pressure but was unable to bridge the gap. SAINT PRADO chased three wide, weakened slightly during the
drive and settled for the show spot. ALTISSIMO settled in hand, got through but failed to improve position. RIDING IN THE WIND failed to respond. MOST
WANTED lagged well back and was always outrun.

Footnotes
OHIO ROSE pressed the pace along the inside, settled off of the leader on the backstretch, shifted out and re-engaged three wide, struck the front a furlong
out and edged clear. UMAMI set the pressured pace three deep, opened clear and angled in after a half, was collared nearing the quarter pole, disputed the
issue to inside the furlong marker but was unable to match strides. THUNDER MAY broke a step slow, moved up five wide, continued on willingly and was
along for the show. PAPPIAS PLEASURE contended three wide, but lacked a response when called upon. STORMED OFF was allowed to settle, closed
the gap through the second turn toward the inside, angled out entering the stretch to make a mild bid, but
failed to sustain the drive.
ANGELOFTHEMORNING was allowed to settle, angled in to save ground, but was never a factor. NA' BAC LEIS was forwardly placed four wide through
the second turn and caved. MISS CHUCKIE H veered out at the start to get away behind his field, was rank to place and wide through the first turn, dropped
well back and trailed.

SKY TIME NOW stalked the pace, drew even after a half, shook clear entering the stretch, was kept to task and maintained a diminishing advantage.
PRETTY GRITTY was allowed to settle, advanced between horses, quickened in the final sixteenth but was unable to bridge the gap. THE RIDGE was
unhurried into stride, took closer order on the second turn, split rivals and loomed a danger but failed to sustain the drive. THIG AR LATHA broke in
bumping SAMURAI JEAN at the start, was forwardly placed three deep, drifted out further leaving the second turn and tired. TIZ ALL BIZ was away alertly,
set a clear pace, was collared after a half, contested the issue to the stretch and retreated. SAMURAI JEAN was bumped and squeezed at the start, settled
in hand four wide, but came up empty before going six furlongs and dropped out.

Footnotes
INDY AWESOME was allowed to settle off of the inside, tipped out to commence his rally five wide midway through the second turn, dug in inside the
furlong marker and was up in the final strides. CHAMPIONOFJUSTICE tracked the pace four wide, reeled in the leader inside the furlong marker, forged a
late lead and kept on well but was unable to resist the winner. FOURINTHEMORNING set the pace along the inside, disputed the issue to the final furlong
and succumbed. TORRONTES was forwardly placed along the inside to the stretch and tired. AESOP settled in hand, moved up four wide, offered a mild
bid but failed to sustain the drive. COLBYVILLE failed to respond. GEPPETTO was never a factor. CUP OF JOY showed little.

Footnotes
ROUTETOO was allowed to settle, circled five wide through the turn, took over entering the stretch and drew clear. G CODE settled saving ground, got
through and finished willingly for the place. DIRECTIONER was close up four wide, loomed a danger but lacked the needed late response. K'S LEGACY
broke through the gate, was allowed to settle, made a mild rally five wide but failed to seriously threaten. ST CECILIA disputed the pace toward the inside,
opened clear midway through the turn, but came up empty entering the stretch. MISS FANDANGO passed only the tiring ones. BOSSY ALEXANDRA broke
through the gate, ran off just over a sixteenth of a mile, broke sharp, but was through early and dropped out. COLLEEN'S SONG sent hard to dispute the
pace, but stopped before going a half.
