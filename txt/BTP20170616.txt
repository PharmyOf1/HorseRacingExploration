Footnotes
SPANISH CANDY was away in good order, attended the pace toward the inside, shifted out and forged command leaving the turn, was kept to task and
drew away. CHANCE OF FROST sent clear to set the pace, was unable to match strides with the winner leaving the turn, but stayed on fairly well and just
held the place. SEANCE was allowed to settle, came three wide and finished with a mild rally. SUSIE'S ALL CLASS was unhurried into stride, finished with
a belated improvement, but was never a factor. ONE LUCKY EGG contended along the inside for a half and tired. DREAMILY broke slow and never
recovered.

Footnotes
THE HANS SUM ONE settled between horses, took closer order through the second turn, circled into the stretch six wide, reeled in the leaders and edged
clear late. KID CAN DO attended the pace along the inside, got through to make a bold bid, gained a short lead a furlong out, kept on well but was unable to
resist the winner. WAR VENTURE stalked the pace in hand, moved up four wide to join the leaders leaving the second turn, but weakened slightly during
the drive. JIM'S FEVER was allowed to settle, came five wide and rallied between rivals. MISTER HOLLOWAY rushed up four wide to contest the pace,
opened clear after a half, was collared again on the second turn and flattened during the drive. QUALITY SPIRITS was allowed to settle, shifted out entering
the stretch and finished with a mild gain. IMAGE OFA PRINCE was slow into stride and passed only the tiring ones. SAYLOR'S STORM failed to respond.
CATCHIN SMOKE was away alertly, angled in to set the pace, was headed before going a half, steadied near the three furlong marker and came up empty
thereafter. APPANOOSE was through after a half.

Footnotes
VEGAMIN was away alertly, disputed the pace three wide, opened clear on the turn, was kept to task and held safe. MS. B V I stalked the pace, launched
her bid four wide, loomed a danger but was unable to bridge the gap. BUCKEYE was hustled along four wide, continued on willingly to earn the show. C. C.
TOP was allowed to settle, finished with a mild rally but failed to seriously threaten. BLACK BLIZZARD was allowed to settle in mid pack and went evenly.
PERSONAL CAT was allowed to settle, made a belated improvement but was never a factor. HOLD ON HATTIE rushed up along the inside to contest the
pace, but came up empty leaving the turn and faded. PRINCESS TINY showed little. FAN C SOCKS failed to respond.

Footnotes
BIG BROWN SEVENS attended the pace along the inside, tipped out to commence his bid, wore down ROJO RIO and kicked clear. ROJO RIO stalked the
pace three deep, took over leaving the second turn, opened clear and kept on well but was unable to match strides with the winner. DESIGNER WIN was
allowed to settle, came five wide and finished willingly to earn the show.. AMERICA'S KITTEN settled saving ground, moved up through the second turn,
shifted out entering the stretch but flattened during the drive. EMIRATES WONDER was unhurried, finished with a belated improvement but failed to
threaten. J. M.'S PARADE hopped at the start, was allowed to settle toward the inside, but failed to make headway. REBEL RESERVE failed to respond.
ROLLING ROCKPORT opened clear to set the pace, was collared on the second turn, and gave way readily once headed. JUST ANOTHER JOHN was
close up three wide, but stopped before going six furlongs.

Footnotes
FANCY BEE was unhurried along the inside, wheeled out six wide leaving the second turn, quickened once uncovered, was up with a rush to narrowly
prevail. PAMPERED VOW opened clear to dictate terms, kept on well but was turned away in the shadow of the wire. MOSTLY AWESOME settled in hand,
came three wide, finished willingly to earn the show. BRIXTON attended the pace along the inside, got through and loomed a danger, but flattened during
the drive. GULF tracked three wide, was a daunting presence entering the stretch, but faltered in the final furlong. KOOKABURRA failed to make headway.
SOUR PEACH was through early. MINING FOR MERCURY trailed.

VHAAR SHE GOES sprinted clear to dictate terms, was collared entering the stretch, relinquished the lead a furlong out, fought back doggedly and turned
back the bid of STEF AND ME in the final strides. STEF AND ME stalked the pace, made a bold bid entering the stretch, poked her head in front a furlong
out, kept on well but was unable to best the determined winner. APPLESLASTCHANCE was allowed to settle, angled out entering the stretch and finished
fairly well to earn the show. SHARPSBURG was allowed to settle, rallied between horses and improved position. SWEETS N TREATS was allowed to
settle, moved up five wide to make a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive. SCENTSATION contended along the inside but lacked a response when called
upon. DEVIL ALERT failed to respond. MISS FRANK E was close up three wide, tucked in on the turn to save ground, but came up empty leaving the turn
and dropped out. SILVER COIN LADY was slow into stride and was never a factor. JACO IA was through early, pulled up entering the stretch and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
JACKSONTOWN shadowed the leaders three deep, took over entering the stretch, was kept to task and widened. MY PARDNER CAL prompted the pace
along the inside, gained a brief lead midway through the turn, was unable to go on with the winner but dug in to hold the place. CITY SLAMMER was
unhurried into stride, lagged at the tail of the field, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, angled entering the stretch and was making up ground.
CAPICHE attended the pace along the inside, got through but lacked the needed late response. FARMER STEVE failed to respond. PIERCE THE SKY was
away alertly, set the pressured pace off of the inside, was collared between horses before going a half and gave way readily once headed.

Footnotes
HAIFA tracked three deep, took over leaving the turn, opened clear and held. I'AM A HOT MESS broke slow, rushed up between horses, angled out
entering the stretch, continued on well but was unable to reach the winner. LIMOGES was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground, got through to make
her bid but flattened during the drive. BROOKLYNNS PRIDE was allowed to settle, finished with a mild rally but failed to seriously threaten. SPIRIT
FINGERS set the pace along the inside, was headed leaving the turn and gave way. BYE BYE CUTIE PIE was allowed to settle in mid pack and lacked a
response. MURRAY HILLBILLY was close up four wide through the turn and tired. LUV MY COUNTRY passed the tiring ones. DESTROZAR showed little.
ATLANTICS ARIEL was outrun.
