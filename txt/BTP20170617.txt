Footnotes
CARIBOU CAT tracked the pace along the inside, shifted out and launched a bold bid three wide, shook clear and maintained a diminishing advantage.
CAP'S TALE was allowed to settle, split horses to make a late rally and was making up ground. HUGH B. attended the pace along the inside, angled out
and loomed large entering the stretch, churned on but was unable to bridge the gap. HEHAZ VISION disputed the pace along the inside through the turn
and weakened. BEST OF TESS was allowed to settle, got through but failed to make headway. COWBOY CHEYENNE contested the pace three wide,
opened clear leaving the turn, but came up empty in the final furlong and faded. ROLLIN WARRIOR failed to respond. EL SALI broke slow, lagged well back
and was distanced through the stretch.

Footnotes
SWARM stalked the pace three wide, moved up to engage the leader on the second turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, shook clear and widened.
SQUEEZE THE KING was rank to place, steadied midway through the first turn, leveled into stride on the backstretch, looped up four wide and continued on
willingly to earn the place. GLADHANDER sent clear to dictate terms, was collared on the second turn, stayed on to the final furlong and gave in.
MAGNETIC START was unhurried into stride, circled six wide and improved position. NIGHT LEAGUE settled between horses but lacked a response when
called upon. ACTIVE SKY made a middle move between horses, offered a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive. SENOR JUAN contended along the inside
to the second turn and dropped out. BROTHER STUART was away alertly, attended the pace along the inside, but came up empty before going six furlongs
and retreated.

Footnotes
FIFTH THIEF contended along the inside, steadied nearing the three-eighths, got through and came again, shifted out a furlong out, quickened and was up
in the final strides. REDNECK RANSOM settled in hand, advanced between horses, opened clear with a furlong to run, kept on well but was denied in the
final jump. PRIMED FOR TALENT contended between horses, came four wide and continued on willingly to earn the show. SACRED PROMISE broke a
step slow, was allowed to settle, circled five wide and improved position. PRADOREY was allowed to settle, made a mild rally but failed to seriously
threaten. SPATETACULAR JOE disputed the pace, opened clear on the backstretch, disputed the issue to the final furlong and faltered. AGGRO CRAG
(IRE) stalked the pace, angled in and moved up to engage the leader on the second turn, but tired entering the stretch and faded. SMOKEN VELVET failed
to respond. KENTUCKY LAKE was outrun. MISTER GLEN vied along the inside, dropped off of the pace into the second turn, checked hard near the three
furlong marker and showed little thereafter.

BLAME THE DREAM settled in hand, ranged up four wide to join the vanguard into the second turn, edged clear entering the stretch, dug in and maintained
a diminishing advantage. BACKSPLASH bobbled at the start, was unhurried into stride, commenced her rally circling five wide, finished well but was unable
to bridge the gap. JASMENE contended between horses, but flattened during the drive and settled for the show. SEE THE BIRD attended the pace along
the inside, got through but lacked the needed late response. PRINCESS EMBER broke slow, rushed to the lead along the inside, was collared entering the
second turn, disputed the issue to the stretch and caved. TIZ ORCHESTRAL contended between horses, checked hard inside the half mile marker, came
up empty thereafter and was distanced through the lane.

SHONI stalked the pace, moved up five wide to join the leaders on the turn, edged clear a furlong out and dug in to prevail. QUEEN OF CORONA tracked in
hand, bid between horses four wide, fought hard through a long drive but wasn't quite good enough. TWIRLING PRINCESS contested the pace between
horses through the turn, then along the inside, but weakened slightly during the drive and settled for the show. NOT SIMPLY SIMON was allowed to settle,
came three wide and improved position. QUE HANSEN vied for the lead between horses, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and dropped out.
RANHANDLE JUSTICE was unhurried, tucked in to save ground, finished with a belated gain but was never a factor. GENTEEL PROMISE disputed the
pace along the inside, but faltered before going a half and retreated. CACTUS LADY was through early.

Footnotes
DRAFT BEER rushed to the lead, angled in to set the pace, fought on through a long drive and held sway. ASCANIUS tracked three wide, kicked on
willingly but was unable to bridge the gap. STARSHIP MERCURY vied for the lead along the inside, settled just off of the pace, shifted out but weakened
slightly during the drive. COABEY was allowed to settle, moved up five wide but lacked the needed late response. JACOPOTAMUS was unhurried into
stride, came six wide and improved position. ROAD HILLS settled in hand five wide and went evenly. REALITY was unhurried early, mounted a rally
between runners but failed to threaten. SUPER CRYBABY was allowed to settle and lacked a response when called upon. RED MACHINE contended along
the inside through the turn and tired. PASS SET HIT was hustled along between horses, but faltered leaving the turn and faded. SMOKEY MON failed to
respond. SKIPAWAY N SEATTLE broke slow, lagged well back and trailed.
