LEELOO'S JOURNEY outrun early while off the rail, split rivals late on the second turn when rallying, angled out a bit and closed well to be clear.
SCATMEIFUCAN close up inside, challenged from the two path on the second turn, drew clear into the stretch but was no match for the winner late.
AUDREY'S DOUBLE outrun along the inside, saved ground on the second turn, angled out for the drive but lodged only a mild late bid. TIZTHESOUND
alternated for the lead off the rail, took over after a half, gained the inside on the second turn, led the field to the stretch and weakened. POR FAVOR within

FIFTH TITLE closest to the pace while outside the leader, challenged when ready on the second turn, raced the leader into defeat into the final furlong and
drew clear. SIXTY FIVE (FR) forwardly placed three wide, stayed in that path on the second turn and lacked the needed closing bid. MONGOL G set the
pace along the inside, responded willingly when challenged on the second turn, raced with the winner into the final furlong but weakened late. PADDY NOT
PATTY within striking distance inside, angled out a bit for the drive but had little left. RACE ME HOME (IRE) behind the leaders near the rail, came off the
inside on the second turn and failed to respond late. KASSEOPIA (GB) outrun early moved out four wide approaching the stretch and showed some late
interest. SPACE MOUNTAIN hopped a bit at the start, was reserved early, raced four wide into the second turn and lodged a mild late bid. MUCHO MACHO
BETS settled early, maintained good position to the stretch and tired. INGADORE was outrun. KISMET'S HEELS within striking distance three wide, tired.

Footnotes
MCCRAKEN lost his footing at the start, was reserved and allowed to settle, made a bold four wide move after a half on his own courage, challenged
midway through that turn, took over in midstretch, drifted to the inside and stayed clear under steady urging. COLONELSDARKTEMPER gained a forward
position in the run to the first turn, angled out to the three path on the second turn, challenged between rivals on the second turn, could not keep pace with
the winner in the stretch but held on gamely for the place. SOCIETY BEAU sluggish at the start, was outrun for a half, made a good three wide middle
move, angled out for the drive but could not sustain the bid. MO'S MOJO closest to the pace while off the inside, challenged with three furlongs to go, held
well to the final furlong and weakened. EXCITATIONS within striking distance along the inside, held on well for six furlongs and tired. AQUAMARINE
sprinted clear, set the pace along the inside and gave way in the final quarter.

Footnotes
KASAQUI (ARG) settled off of the inside, made a sweeping move four wide, struck the front nearing the furlong marker and shook clear. CHOCOLATE
RIDE set the pace along the shrub, was unable to go on with the winner but dug in gamely to prove best of the rest. CONQUEST PANTHERA was
unhurried into stride, settled off of the hedge, tipped out entering the stretch and kicked on well to earn the show. BONDURANT was close up three deep,
moved up to engage the leader nearing the quarter pole, but weakened between runners and gave way. BLOFELD was unhurried, tucked in to save ground,
swung to the outside in the upper stretch and finished with a belated improvement. PLEUVEN (FR) settled in hand three deep through the opening half, then
between rivals, was bottled up in traffic inside the final furlong and failed to make headway. THATCHER STREET attended the pace along the hedge, got
through but lacked a response when called upon. SECURITY RISK prompted the pace to the outside of CHOCOLATE RIDE through the first turn, settled
just off of that one on the backstretch, but came up empty between horses after a mile and retreated.

Footnotes
FOREVER UNBRIDLED settled saving ground through the opening half mile, worked her way off of the inside for clear sailing, ranged up four wide through
the second turn with ease, came five wide into the lane, reeled in the stubborn APOLOGYNOTACCEPTED inside the furlong marker, shook off that one and
edged clear. APOLOGYNOTACCEPTED was away in good order, angled in to dictate terms, repelled the challenge of BIG WORLD leaving the second
turn, shook clear again and fought on through a long drive but was unable to go on with the winner. CARRUMBA attended the pace off of the inside, tipped
out further entering the stretch, churned on but failed to make headway through the drive. BIG WORLD tracked three deep, moved up to engage
APOLOGYNOTACCEPTED with five-sixteenths to run, but weakened slightly during the drive and gave way. TIGER MOTH was allowed to settle, moved up
four wide to make a mild bid, angled in entering the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. WEEP NO MORE was unhurried, dropped to the rail to save
ground, got through into the stretch, shifted out a bit for the final furlong and finished with a mild improvement. WALKABOUT came away a beat slow, was
unhurried along the inside and failed to threaten. ROMANTIC VISION settled toward the inside, but lacked a response when called upon.

Footnotes
GUN RUNNER quickly opened clear to dictate terms, shrugged off the bid of STANFORD leaving the second turn, smartly drew away and was in hand the
final yards. HONORABLE DUTY was allowed to settle, moved up four wide to make his bid, brushed with BREAKING LUCKY through the drive but kept on
well to earn the place. BREAKING LUCKY attended the pace along the inside, shifted out between runners entering the stretch, brushed with HONORABLE
DUTY through the drive and failed to make headway. HAWAAKOM broke a step slow, angled in to save ground, got through to make his move, was blocked
and steadied near the furlong marker, altered course to the outside but lost his best chance. STANFORD tracked three wide, took a futile run at GUN
RUNNER midway through the second turn, flattened once straightened for the stretch run and retreated. TEXAS CHROME was allowed to settle, angled out
six wide but failed to threaten. MO TOM was never a factor. BIRD SONG settled between horses, but came up empty on the second turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
SWEEPING PADDY was well placed off of the inside, launched her bid four wide entering the stretch, took over and quickly drew away. PROCTOR'S
LEDGE was allowed to settle toward the inside, advanced between horses, angled out entering the stretch and continued on well. SUMMER LUCK was
nearest the pace off of the hedge, came three wide and kept on well but was unable to match strides with the top two. CHUBBY STAR settled in hand,
moved up between horses, came four wide into the stretch, altered course out and around the fast fading LIKE A HURRICANE nearing the eighth pole and
was making up ground. FIZZY FRIDAY (GB) was allowed to settle, circled into the stretch six wide and improved position. SAMEEHA tucked in while never
far back, got through to make a bold bid, but came up empty in the final furlong and faded. STARR BEAR contended between horses but went evenly. LA
MANTA GRIS was unhurried, finished with a belated gain but was never a factor. SAVANNAH BELLE saved ground to no avail. BLAME THE LAW showed
little. ANOTHERTEQUILASHOT lunged at the start to get away slow, mounted a mild rally five wide on the second turn but failed to sustain the drive. LIKE
A HURRICANE sprinted clear to set the pace, drifted out entering the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
MISS KENTUCKY rushed to the lead along the inside, shook clear entering the stretch and held safely. MELLWOOD SUMMER was allowed to settle, came
five wide and finished willingly for the place. GOLDEN AMBER stalked the pace in hand, came three wide, continued on well but settled for the minor award.
THIRTEEN SONGS was close up between horses, but weakened during the drive and gave way. BELLETTA was unhurried into stride, angled out seven
wide and improved position. SOCATA was allowed to settle, angled out but failed to make headway. NUMBERS GAME settled in hand, moved up between
horses to make a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive. SWEET TATUM attended the pace along the inside, but was through before going a half.
MISSSEVENTHIRTEEN chased three wide but stopped on the turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
PORTAL attended the pace four wide, came to level terms on the second turn, forged a narrow lead entering the stretch and dug in stubbornly. FIREBALL
SHOT was allowed to settle, moved up five wide through the second turn, kept on well but was unable to best the determined winner. LEADING CAUSE
pulled to the fore between horses, disputed the pace doggedly, but grudgingly gave in. TAPSOLUTE was allowed to settle, angled in to save ground,
slipped through in rail skimming fashion and was making up ground. SEVIER settled saving ground, moved up through the second turn, shifted out but
flattened during the drive. HARLAN'S VADOR (ARG) was allowed to settle, moved up four wide to make a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive. HARD
FOUGHT opened clear to set the pace, was collared on the backstretch, contested the issue to the second turn, was headed near the five-sixteenths pole
and gave way readily. FORD'SPOWERSTROKE was outrun. UNBRIDLED REBEL was forwardly placed along the inside to the second turn and stopped.
