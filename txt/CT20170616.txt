Footnotes
REALLY BOPPIN hustled clear past the half mile pole to set the pace, was asked for more leaving the five sixteenths and held on under steady
encouragement. MONTAGUE BAY chased the pace toward mid track, raced in the four path rounding the turn then drifted out through the lane while
gaining on the winner. BIG DISTINCTION chased the pace toward the outside, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened stride the final sixteenth.
SHADOWS OF LOVE was unprepared for the break and raced well back early on, angled outward on the turn, entered the stretch widest and finished
evenly. BEYOND CITY LIMITS chased the leaders while racing off the rail then weakened through the lane.

Z NATION stalked the pace on the outside and took the lead near the quarter pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, drew clear past the
three-sixteenths pole, then drove down the lane and widened under a hand ride. PARADISE BIRD hustled up and angled in to rate the pace inside, was
caught near the quarter pole, rounded the turn on the rail, lost ground leaving the turn, then dug in gamely down the lane but was outfinished. SCATTY'S
GIRL saved ground in the first turn and settled well off the pace on the inside, made a bid approaching the three-eighths pole, improved through the turn on
the rail, then dug in under steady handling and finished evenly. ANA RUTH settled off the pace on the outside and made a bid nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, dropped back through the turn in the three path, then flattened in the lane. MY HAT and DYNAPOSSE were never factors.

the lead toward the five sixteenths, dueled clear into the far turn, lost some ground leaving the turn and dueled with the edge to deep stretch before leveling
off. SAILAWAY raced in the four path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail, took aim midstretch then leveled off
toward the wire. PREACHERMAN R V F saved ground well off the pace the opening turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the
four path and finished evenly to pass tiring rivals. STERLINGS MR. ABEL settled off the pace and off the rail then showed little response through the
backstretch. E MAN MOJO bobbled a bit leaving the gate, rated with the pace inside through the front stretch, raced clear past the five eighths pole, was

Footnotes
LIKE ME OR NOT broke awkwardly then gave chase inside, improved through the turn in the three path, dueled in the upper stretch and took the lead
approaching the sixteenth pole, then widened to the wire. AYE FANCEY gave chase well off the pace on the outside, rounded the turn off the rail, then
drove determinedly down the stretch, gaining and passing rivals, to finish well. FINLEY'S FORTUNE gave chase well back inside, steadily improved through
the turn in the four path, then gained down the stretch to finish well. CHARITABLE BOUND gave chase on the outside, took the turn in the six path, then
raced down the lane, gaining, to finish well. BROOKSIE ROBINSON hustled up and angled in to rate a clear pace inside, rounded the turn on the rail, was
headed past the eighth pole, then dueled in the upper stretch but was caught near the sixteenth pole and faded. STAR STELLA gave chase inside, rounded
the turn on the rail, then faded in the stretch. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE gave chase a distant second inside, raced around the turn on the rail, then flattened in
the lane. DIAMOND CAUSEWAY gave chase on the outside, then faded through the turn in the five path. CHARITABLE ANN was slow getting into stride
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
KITTYCAT HEIR broke through the gate prior to the start then chased the pace on the outside, rounded the turn in the three path, then dueled down the
stretch and came up just under the wire. MY LADY MUNNINGS battled to the front to rate the pace two wide on the outside, angled in to round the turn on
the rail, then dueled down the stretch but ceded at the wire. CHEROKEE BLESSING gave chase three wide on the outside at a distant third, was carried out
into the turn to the six path, then was gaining on the two frontrunners and just lasted for third. HIGH DIVE gave chase two wide between horses, angled in
past the five-sixteenths pole to round the turn on the rail, then weakened in the lane and just missed third. SMOKIN' SEANCE gave chase inside, fell behind
approaching the five-sixteenths pole, started the turn in the four path, then angled in through the turn to the two path, and finished evenly. FONDTASTIC
chased the pace inside, was checked from a narrowing opening approaching the turn, bore out into the turn to the four path, then finished evenly.

Footnotes
OFFICER RIDGE stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead midway on the far turn, raced clear toward the head of the
lane and opened up the final sixteenth. JUST A LIL LUKEY raced well off the pace about the three path the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and got up for second in later yards. NOSEY NORTON rated a short lead inside, was pressured past the three eighths
pole, caught midway on the far turn, dropped back approaching the head of the lane and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. NO HUNTING stalked the
pace two deep, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole then flattened stride through the lane. TRUE MAGIC settled off the pace and off the
rail the first turn, eased out into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole but bore out on the far turn, entered the stretch extremely wide and
showed little further. ROAD GLITTER raced five wide into the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. ONE LAST CHANCE became
edgy in the gate and lost ground into the first turn, raced outside entering the backstretch and was not a factor. THE RITE GROOM was carried out into the
first turn and never factored. AARONS BELL saved ground close to the pace the first turn then faded past the seven sixteenths pole.
