Footnotes
SVINDAHL stalked the pace then challenged CEREBRAL in the two path leaving the far turn and drew clear under pressure. CROWN THY GOOD rallied
three wide around the far turn then lacked the needed closing bid. CEREBRAL saved ground setting the pace then faded in the drive. CATCHER prompted
the pace then also faded in the stretch run. ARTIE'S FLIGHT was boxed in along the inside much of the trip. SCRAPPLE failed to be a threat. ENVISION
SUCCESS tired. TRAVEL TRUE showed little.

Footnotes
GHOST HUNTER was well placed racing close up along the inside and rallied into the stretch then closed with good energy to get up in the late stages.
RING WEEKEND was unhurried early, came four wide around the far turn to gain the lead then wasn't quite good enough for the winner and was caught
late. BERN' JAMES BERN broke alertly to set the pace then was not quite good enough late. CHIROPRACTOR, unhurried early, worked his way in traffic in
midstretch and finished gamely. MARENGO ROAD raced within striking distance and responded well in the drive. POSTULATION prompted the pace then
lacked the needed rally. GO AROUND engaged for the lead two wide on the far turn then was pinched off in tight quarters in upper stretch. DOMO
ARTIEGATO lacked a rally. A claim of foul by the rider of GO AROUND against the winner for interference in the stretch was not allowed following a
stewards inquiry.
