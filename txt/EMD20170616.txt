Footnotes
LA BRISA raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch, reached the fore soon after and drew off with
complete authority. PERSONAL IMAGE was away in good order to dispute the pace with MY MOM while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival after going
five furlongs, opened a clear lead into the lane but could not match strides with the winner through the final furlong. CAT CAMILLE settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. MAGIC QUESTION was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through
the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. SILLY STREAK steadied soon after the start then was allowed to settle, raced five-wide through
the second turn and was not a factor. MY MOM broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside and weakened after going five furlongs.

Footnotes
ATTA BOY DOUGIE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased his advantage when set down for the drive and was ridden
out to the wire to be kept to task. BET THE GOLD veered in at the start, was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, reached a
striking position into the lane but could not gain on the winner in the drive. GALEFORCE NINE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn and finished evenly. PARKER'S PRINCE was away alertly to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. ROJO BOU PEEP
was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. TIME TO FIRE was forwardly placed from between foes
throughout and gradually weakened. ROWDY RAIDER showed no early speed, raced off the rail throughout and was not a factor.

FEEL THE CHARGE was bumped at the start, appeared hard to rate, stalked the pace of MARA'S WARLOCK while racing three-wide, moved up to take
command after going five furlongs, opened a clear margin and held sway to the wire. STUCK RIVER raced unhurried early, raced three-wide through the
second turn, checked nearing the quarter and finished with good energy when clear. KAIULANI was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the second turn, reached a contending position but lacked the needed late response. TATTYPOO was bumped at the break, lacked early foot,
raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished with some late run. JIMA hopped at the start, showed brief
speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. MARA'S WARLOCK sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and

RAVIZZONE raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the lane, split rivals with a furlong to run, bumped with MY WAY
OR ELWAY nearing the sixteenth pole and drew clear through the final yards. HEART'S MELODY dueled for the lead from the inside throughout and gave
way grudgingly in the drive. TODDIES HOTTIE was away in good order to press the pace four-wide, moved five-wide through the turn and finished willingly
in the drive. PEBBLES FURY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run and finished with some late
run. MY WAY OR ELWAY was off slow, advanced from between foes to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied, bumped with the winner nearing the sixteenth
pole and gave way. STORMIN NORMA L broke sharply to dispute the pace from between foes and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
HEROES FOR GHOSTS broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear lead into the lane and was fully extended to hold ONE
MORE ORMAN safe late. ONE MORE ORMAN was off slow, raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and
finished with good late energy. DUSTIN'S PASSION was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run and was
gaining late. WANDO CAT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. SEARCHINFORABREEZE settled
off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. CADDY SHACK CAT was away in good order to press the
pace of the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. SILVER CHROME chased the winner while racing four-wide and weakened
after three furlongs.
