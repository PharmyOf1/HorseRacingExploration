Footnotes
HELLO BROWN stalked the pace of SOUTHERN SOLUTION while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the seven-sixteenths pole,
responded when challenged by TRIBAL WATERS nearing the quarter, vied with that foe and edged away through the final yards. TRIBAL WATERS was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid nearing the quarter, vied with the winner but could not match
strides late. KAHULUI BLUFF was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, raced four-wide through the first turn, advanced five-wide through the second turn
and finished evenly late. DEPUTY'S COMMAND lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and did not threaten.
DRINK TIL YOU DROP was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. SOUTHERN SOLUTION sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail
while setting the pace, weakened after going five-furlongs, was eased through the lane and vanned off.

Footnotes
MAURICE CODE was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead with HART MOUNTAIN while racing three-wide, drifted out approaching the stretch, vied with
that foe through a prolonged drive and held gamely. HART MOUNTAIN was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside
throughout and just missed through a hard drive. FASHION PROSPECT was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing four-wide, angled out in
mid-stretch and failed to gain on the top two. NO TALKING was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders from off the rail and lacked the needed closing
response. PARTY FOR ONE showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and was not a factor. CHATTY
CARL was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. YOUSEEHEREYOUSEE raced off the pacesetters early,
moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
HOT BOBBY raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the second turn, angled out with a sixteenth to run and was up in the final
jump.
REGALSTONE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased his advantage through the back-stretch, maintained a safe margin
with a furlong to run, drifted in late and just failed to last. HORSTY was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the
drive, reached a striking position in mid-stretch, steadied when REGALSTONE drifted in late and failed to gain. AFFLUENT ASSET hopped at the start, was
allowed to settle, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and showed some late run. CALEX was bumped at the start, chased
the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going six furlongs. TRES TWAIN was bumped at the break, then forwardly placed, raced four-wide
through the second turn and gradually weakened. GOOD COMPANY was pulled up soon after the start and walked off. THE RIDER OF HORSTY LODGED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST REGALSTONE CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF HER MOUNT NEARING THE WIRE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE
FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

into deep stretch and drew clear through the final yards. CITIZEN KITTY broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged
by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied but could not match strides with that foe late. PERHAPS A PIE was bumped at the start, showed no
early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. PROTECTIVE SHIELD hopped at the start, raced just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. B C Z MIDDLETON was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and
failed to menace. PRINCESS KENNEDY lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. MY HEART GOES ON was
bumped at the start and bobbled, moved up quickly to press the pace from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
SUGARSEEKER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the lane, angled in nearing the furlong
marker and was up in the final jump. MADAME CLOUET was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by
WINNINGFASHION nearing the three-eighths marker, vied with that foe and just failed to last by the narrowest of margins. LUCK OUT settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and finished willingly. WINNINGINFASHION chased the pace of
MADAME CLOUET from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, vied and gave way through the final furlong. KADESHA (FR)
showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not menace. RALLYDOWNTHEALLEY was void of early foot, raced three-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. LIVE LIKE MIKE pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. DIAMOND CUT
was void of early speed, saved ground throughout and did not reach contention.

SADIE'S SNOWFLAKE lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. APHRODITIES KISS showed brief speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and weakened. REMY ROYALE bobbled at the start, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace.
