Footnotes
FEISTY EMBRACE floated in slightly at the start, pressured the leader from the outside, slight drift upper stretch, drew alongside that one past the furlong
marker to put a head in front, edging away late under pressure. SARAH'S HOLY BELLE broke on top set the pace inside, continued to show the way
approaching the furlong grounds, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, well clear of the others. LUCKY TAYLOR broke in then steadied after being a bit
reluctant to load, raced back off the pace, four wide through the turn, drifted out stretch, just lasted for the show. BORN TO D' WILD broke in, lacked speed,
floated out a bit to be in the four path out of the turn, set down, was gaining for the show spot while inside LUCKY TAYLOR. MY HALF behind the pace
while along the inside, checked up into the turn when bothered, did not recover in failing to menace. MY SHARP PAL angled in entering the turn when off
the pace, steady retreat through the stretch, finished well back.

the place. WHAT A IMAGE devoid of early foot, saved ground through the turn, rallied up the inside to annex the show. TIZ BLESSED ONE settled off the
pace in mid pack, turned in and even effort. FIRST PRIZE YANKEE unruly in the gate prior to the start, broke in good order, raced forwardly for three

Footnotes
I'M A C LOOKER broke sharp, set the pace toward the inside, widened turn, continued to increase advantage through the lane while being kept to task.
MUDDY BAYOU hesitated at the start, raced back after moving outside, five wide out of the turn, rallied willingly down the middle of the strip to be clear for
the place, no match for the winner. ANIMAL COOKIE broke out, bothered rival, came five wide out of the turn, also rallied while well out in the strip to annex
the show. RUSTY KOOL DRIVE settled in the second flight inside, continued to save ground turn, in a bit tight past the furlong marker, finished up evenly
after recovering. PAPA BUCK lacked early foot, improved position without posing a serious threat. CRUSHEM TANK in the second group while racing off
the inside, was not making headway past the furlong marker when he lugged in to tighten up RUSTY KOOL DRIVE then gave way. COAST GUARD KID off
slowly, continued to race back, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. HOPE FOR A STAR raced in mid pack for a half, had little left for the drive.
ACT DIABLO in the second group while between horses for a half, gave way in the drive. BULLY'S DATE bothered at the start, moved a bit closer on the
outside in the turn, also faltered in the drive. EASY FORM was finished early. LARIAT'S INTEREST steadily faded. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL TIME HAND

Footnotes
SOLID SOUTH broke near the back, was taken outside, continued in the five path in the run up the backstretch, roused late in the final turn, rallied down the
middle of the strip to up in time. THISCATSATALKIN in the second group while outside, came four wide into the lane, closed on the leaders with good
resolve, late bid, led, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. SHEDROW COCKTAILS broke with the leaders, set a moderate pace toward the
inside, shook clear in the final turn, continued to show the way past the furlong marker, could match the top two late, saved the show. LION WARRIOR went
one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. QUIET SEDUCTION pressured the leader from the outside for six furlongs and began to weaken.
MALIBU COURT broke back, lacked early foot, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. CAPTAIN TYREE was always outrun. GRACE'S
BANDIT raced toward the front for five furlongs, gave way.

Footnotes
ANDY'S PRODUCTION headed up the second flight off the inside, advanced and challenged in the four path and between horses turning for home, drove
well clear. KELCORCEE made an early move into a forward position the opening quarter, challenged five wide turning for home, proved no match for the
winner in the drive, held the place. HOLY BEAU last to leave, lacked speed, came six wide out of the turn, rallied mid track to be rapidly getting to the runner
up late. CAPOTE P. in the second group while racing toward the inside, continued to save some ground turn, got through along the rail inside of a tiring rival
past the furlong marker continued in even and non threatening fashion to the wire. DIXIELAND NATIVE back off the pace, steadied slightly along the inside
with a half mile remaining, improved position after recovering while also not posing a serious threat. LANIES CHOICE broke sharp, dueled into and through
the turn, weakened in the drive. LEES STONE lacked early foot, failed to rally. TASTE BUD forwardly placed outside, dueled the middle quarter, gave way
in the drive. COME ON SID remained always back. SQUIRTSQUIRT mid pack early in some traffic, steadied into the turn, fell back.

Footnotes
HEAVEN'S DEVIL moved up inside to vie after a quarter, continued to contest the issue through the turn, came out slightly into the stretch while regaining
the advantage, pulled away. LATE APPOINTMENT back off the pace while racing outside, loomed a threat four wide late in the turn, briefly put a head in
front entering the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner late, remained clear for the place. THEGOODWITCH vied up front while between rivals, fell
back off the top two a bit late in the turn, moved out slightly for the drive, all out to narrowly last for the show. ALIVIA'S LION lacked early foot, steered out to
be five wide into the lane, outkicked for the show spot while remaining well wide. SWAMPED void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never
dangerous. QUICK DRAW RONNIE with the early pace, was finished after a half. RINGNECKDOVE flashed speed for four furlongs and stopped. HALF
MILE FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
ZAMIDUE settled off the leader, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch, four wide bid turning for home, drove clear. THE BIRDMAN lacked early
foot off the inside, came four wide and behind the winner into the lane, finished up willingly to be up for the place, no match for the victor. SMART AGENDA
alternated up front while closest to the inside, briefly offered resistance to the winner entering the stretch then could not keep pace, caught late for the place.
ELITE SCORE last away, raced back, displayed a modest amount to late interest to improve position. TUMULT broke alertly, set or forced the pace for over
six furlongs and weakened. LITTLE MARIO remained back in lacking a late response. BOSTON BOB settled in mid pack early, had little for the drive.
TOAST TO DON headed up the second flight early, began a steady fade before a half. SURE CAN DO was always back, became more sluggish as the race
progressed, eased into the stretch, walked back to be unsaddled.

Footnotes
SUPPOSE SO broke to the outside, was straightened and worked her way clear before a quarter, was given a breather through the turn, maintained
daylight through the stretch without feeling the whip to win ridden out. SHOW'EM THE HEAT broke out top, allowed the winner to clear, moved out, stalked
that one through the turn, three path while maintaining contact with that rival into the lane, fell back a bit past the furlong marker then was slowly getting
back to that same rival late. DALE'S LIL SIS off a bit slow, trailed inside, moved out a bit to overtake a tiring rival late in the turn, moved out a bit for the drive
and staged a mild rally to be along for the show. MINE YOURS AN OURS within striking distance for a half, came up empty for the drive, caught late for the
show. VANISHING IMAGE was finished by late in the turn. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

no match for the winner late, lasted for the place. ZACKSGOTTHIS lacked speed off the inside, raced three out to four wide turn, set down for the drive and
was getting to the runner up late. MARTIN DE TOURS settled off the pace, continued one paced in lacking a closing response. MOMENT OF TIME bumped
at the start, raced in mid pack, also found lacking when called on for the drive. V DOUBLE U fell back after a quarter, also lacked a late kick.
REVENUENEUTRAL off slowly, raced back and four wide through the turn, failed to rally. EUTYCHUS bumped at the start, remained always back. ROYAL
ASCOT ZIP pressured the runner up early, stopped in the drive, eased, jogged under the wire.
