set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the second turn, then weakened late and held the show. STEVIE THE CAT well placed and
outside, angled in through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, could not gain and held a share. J. R.'S GOOD GIRL rated back,
tracked the pace and faded after a half. BEN AND JIGGY'S broke slightly awkwardly, was never involved.

rivals for a share. FROSTY ZEN stalked the pace from between rivals and faded through the turn. BUBBE ZENA set the pace on the inside and had no

LARA never far back, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off in the late going.
BUSTED HANDLE well placed, looped two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly
best of the rest. ROARING BELLE stalked the pace on the inside, came through inside of that one into the lane, weakened and held the show. DOUBLE
THE SILK passed tiring rivals for a share. DARN THAT TRIP set the early pace on the outside and faded in the drive. AGGI'S QUEEN was a brief factor,

Footnotes
SIX SIDED BLING mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch, took command, then drew off and was
kept to the task. I WIN stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and could not gain
the final furlong. THE UNDERSHERIFF set the pace on the inside, shook clear, stayed on when challenged in the lane, weakened late and held the show.
MARK TWAIN passed tiring rivals for share. INVESTIGATOR rated close up, faded after a half and was vanned off. PERSIAN POET showed little, inside.

gain and drove clear. ZABABA well placed and three wide, held position while angling in through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
closed willingly and lacked the needed late kick. STEEL GRIT chased the pace on the inside, angled out through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and
got up for the show. EXPEDITER set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged in the stretch, weakened late and held a share. SUNDAY
SOLDIER stalked the pace from between rivals, held position through the turn three wide and had no stretch rally. ELUSIVE NEW YORKER broke out at the
