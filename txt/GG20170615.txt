CHEERS TO YOU was chasing MAMA'S SECRETSTORM to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down for the drive, pushed to the front
in mid stretch and was under steady pressure to the line. STORMY ENDEAVOR was outsprinted to the turn, circled three wide to the stretch then finished
willingly to be second best. MAMA'S SECRETSTORM pushed to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then could not stall the winner and
finished evenly. MY PROJECT GIRL also was chasing to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response.

Footnotes
BRITE CRISTIAN was always well placed, raced two wide on the second turn, pushed up to engage the leader to mid stretch then dug in determinedly to
prevail. BOBBY MAGIC set the pace to the second turn, responded saving ground to the stretch, was collared by the winner a furlong out then battled to
save the place. MAGIK PEPPER eased in soon after the start to save ground but was caught in tight behind BOBBY MAGIC and raced in check to the five
eighths, remained behind that one to the second turn, was boxed inside to the stretch then angled out for room, responded when clear but could not make
an impact. SUNNY DEE had no speed, trailed to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch, was fanned out widest for the drive then drifted in while
slightly erratic, got pulled back out in mid stretch and just missed third. FORBID had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid three wide then eased down to
the two path into the stretch but could not muster the needed late response. TAILORED was chasing to the half, raced three wide to the stretch but
weakened in the drive. TAKEAGOODLOOK settled mid pack, raced four wide throughout and gave way after six furlongs.

TWICE AS FAST broke alertly, went right to the front, set the pace while off the rail to the stretch then responded to kick away to mid stretch and held
driving. LUCKY LUCCIANA chased the pace from the rail to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch but battled late to get the place. THIS'S HOW WE
ROLL pressed the winner three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then lost second late. THATABOYROY tracked the winner two then three
wide to the stretch but failed to offer a late response. PEPPER MAGIC broke a bit slow and was never a factor. ROYAL CHARTER was always outrun.

BARHANPOUR (FR) was unhurried for a half mile, raced two wide on the second turn, eased out for room once in the stretch then rallied, collared SAXON
LORD nearing the sixteenth marker and edged clear driving. SAXON LORD pressed the pace to the second turn, dueled two wide to the stretch, inched
away under urging to mid stretch then could not stall the winner while not threatened for second. SHADES OF VICTORY chased the pace to the second
turn, was asked for speed three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. UNDENIABLE U also chased the leader for a half mile, saved
ground to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. MELVILLE set the pace under pressure for five furlongs, was overtaken and passed in upper stretch
then tired.

Footnotes
SIZZLIN' JOE had no speed, settled to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch, closed steadily to take the lead a sixteenth out and held
determinedly. AMERICAN ARISTOCAT stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide and dueled to mid stretch, was collared by the winner leaving
the furlong grounds but dug in late to hold second. ROYAL BANKER (GB) had no speed, trailed to the second turn, raced three wide then swung out widest
for the drive and closed willingly but too late. DYNAMIC SCORING attended the pace outside of NEPTUNE'S SPEAR, was two wide to the stretch then was
outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. NEPTUNE'S SPEAR had good speed, dueled from the rail for six furlongs, was passed in mid stretch and
weakened. SMALL TOWN COP was chasing to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. SIBERIAN LAUGHTER also chased the pace to the second
turn, was two wide to the stretch but broke down in mid stretch, was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
YAHOO TAHOE was outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down for the drive and closed willingly to prevail.
MAH GELLIN stalked the pace to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied in the drive, had the lead for a brief time in deep stretch but was outfinished
by the winner. MR. JAY D had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch then eased out and closed willingly but too late. GUY CODE stalked the pace to the
turn, saved ground to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. INDIAN BRUT pressed the pace to the turn, bid three wide to take the lead into the
stretch, led to mid stretch but tired in the final furlong. JOHNNY REB broke poorly and was last about five or six lengths, raced off the rail on the turn and
was closing the gap in the late stages. ALL INDIANS hustled to the front, set the pace from off the rail to the middle of the turn, was collared at that point
and tired in the stretch. HYPNATIQUE was mid pack to the turn, had to circle five wide to the stretch but gave way in the final furlong.

PLEASE DO was unhurried to the half, rallied two then three wide on the second turn, pushed to the front in mid stretch and drew clear driving. AWAKEN
MY SOUL chased the pace for five furlongs, moved up two wide on the second turn, took a brief lead in upper stretch but was quickly caught by the winner
then dug in late to save second. LADIESABLAZIN had no speed, settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then could not threaten in
the drive and missed the place. FORCE OF TEN trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch and picked off rivals without menacing the winner.
NAMORITA was chasing for a half mile, got fanned four wide to the stretch and lacked a closing response. GILDED had no speed, was off the rail on both
turns and never menaced. RALLY BACK hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then tired. PLAY NICE pressed RALLY BACK early,
was outrun on the second turn and gave way in the drive.
