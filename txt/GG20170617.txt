Footnotes
ALMOST A SAINT bumped with BELLE'S COMMAND at the start then pressed the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide and dueled with the runnerup
through the final furlong but gamely bested that one late. ESPERANZA'S MOBILE stalked the pace to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch,
dueled through the stretch with the winner but got outfinished. KNOLL lagged to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch and closed with a rush late.
WINTER'S NEST tracked the pace to the half, bid three wide on the second turn then finished steadily but could not make an impact. SHINING EVA
contested the pace while off the rail for six furlongs but tired in the stretch. DON'T YOU WANT ME had no speed and was not a factor. BELLE'S COMMAND
bumped with the winner at the start then was also always outrun.

FLY LEXIS FLY was unhurried to the half, rallied three wide to get to terms into the stretch then pushed to the front in mid stretch and held determinedly.
LAZZAM (GB) broke a bit slow and had no speed, advanced two wide to the stretch then shifted out in mid stretch, responded, could not catch the winner
but got the nod for second. PEPPER CROWN also had no speed, settled to the half, bid three wide to the stretch then finished willingly. MY DISCRETION
was four wide while dueling on the first turn, attended the pace two wide to the stretch but weakened in mid stretch. DROUILLARD had no speed, trailed to
the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then closed a gap without being a threat. BLUEGRASS BRONCO chased the pace to the half, was two wide
to the stretch then lacked a closing response. CARTOONIST dueled three wide to the backstretch, eased in and saved ground to the middle of the second
turn but stopped after six furlongs and was jogged in the final furlong.

and third. OKANA was tracking the pace to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but could not muster the needed response. HIGHLAND ROSE got
outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch but did not rally. GUNNY had no speed, was three wide on the turn but never threatened. MONARCA'S

Footnotes
GURNICK had no speed, settled for a half mile, bid two wide into the second turn then swung out four wide into the stretch, responded when set down and
closed with a strong run to win going away. NAHEM dueled for the lead while off the rail on both turns, responded determinedly to deep stretch then was no
match for the winner but held second. ARCHITOP was outside of NAHEM and contested the pace three wide for six furlongs, responded to deep stretch
then went evenly late but held the show. ROCKIN ROBIN was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, rallied two then three wide to the
stretch, responded when straightened and closed with a good late rally. PRESS BARON (GB) had no speed, trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the
stretch but could not make an impact late. DANAS BEST (AUS) tracked the pace to the half, bid two wide on the second turn but weakened in the drive.
LOTA SPUNK chased the pace to the half, saved ground to the stretch but also was giving way late. VENTURI stalked the pace three or four wide for five
furlongs then tired and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
KIMBERLEA K sizzled on the front end to open a long lead to the turn, maintained that advantage to the stretch and was under mild urging to the wire.
LITTLE DOE was outrun to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then closed a bit late for the place. MISS SHIRLEY C was outsprinted to the turn,
raced up into traffic and had to check from the five sixteenths until inside the quarter pole then had a mild late bid. ROYAL LOOKIN had no speed, was three
wide to the stretch but never threatened. COLONEL DEERING chased the winner three wide but came up empty in the drive. BORNONVALENTINEDAY
waited for a couple of counts in the gate and came out about eight or nine lengths last and lost any chance. HYPHY chased the pace early, was two wide to
the stretch then weakened. TIGER MOM was also outsprinted then saved ground to no avail. HOT HONEY CAROL gave a dull debut.

Footnotes
RAGAZZA DI VOLA was well placed to the second turn, rallied two wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch then took over and held under strong
urging. QUEEN SCHEHERAZADE had no speed, settled to the half, shifted off the rail on the second turn, rallied when set down and surged in the final
sixteenth to just miss. ENCHANTED JASMINE settled mid pack to the second turn, got pushed out four wide to the stretch then also rallied late but was
outfinished. FLIKA pressed the leader for a half mile, moved up to take over two wide on the second turn, responded to mid stretch but was overtaken and
tired in the late stages. BENCHMARK ROSE had no speed, got fanned four wide on the second turn and could not make an impact in the drive. HAVING
FUN was allowed to settle to the half, raced three wide to the stretch and also lacked a late response. BONNIE'S RANSOM chased the pace to the second

turn, got pushed out and circled four wide to the stretch then weakened. SHAYNA PUNIMS broke slow, had no speed and was never a factor. SHE'S
PRETTY WINDY was awkward at the start, also had no speed and did not threaten. GOLDEN BUBBLES hustled to the front, set the pace to the second
turn then stopped. CINZIA stalked the pace three wide for six furlongs then gave out.
