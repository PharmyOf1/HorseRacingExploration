Footnotes
GRAND JR vied for lead in opening stages, steadied slightly and edged back just off leader, was set down for the drive, reached SAILOR'S COMPANION
approaching the quarter pole, wrested for command then drew clear. SAILER'S COMPANION vied for lead in opening stages then took clear control of the
lead, saved ground and continued on top into lane, fought back but could not move on for late lead. DADDY DUKE raced off early speed, advanced position
moving up off top two, continued steady five wide bid to wire. POLICY PORTFOLIO tossed head at the start, coming away last, raced off early speed,
swung out for the drive and produced decent finish. REVOLVER SESSIONS was just step slow at the start then quickly moved up closer along inside, got in
tight, steadied, kept on, needed more. STARSHIP MENACE lacked early speed and failed to threaten leaders in lane. SVETIK raced up close then steadied
a bit while racing along the outside of FATHER LOVE, could not sustain needed pace in turn, steadily weakened. FATHER LOVE raced up close in opening
quarter then gaveway.

Footnotes
EDITORIAL was rated under snug hold through backstretch, picked up pace in far turn then was set down three to four wide for the drive, dug in gamely, up
late. GEMOLOGISTER set the early pace, repelled bids and widened advantage to clear lead in lane, continued on top nearing wire, got caught in final
strides. DEVISE was allowed to settle in early stages while saving ground along inside, angled out and headed in pursuit near quarter pole, was no late
match for clear top two leaders but dug in and held share. KING MAURO was well reserved racing in the back, raced along rail into lane, lacked room,
angled out, improved but could not get by for show. SIMMARDSTRIKE tracked up close then lost position, came under a ride just off inside in the lane,
finished evenly. MONETARY SYSTEM steadied along inside then checked upon entering early backstretch, continued off the pace then drifted out wide for
drive. ARCHER ROAD raced under snug hold while rated, settled then lost position after the half, kept along outside into lane, no impact. STUN raced up
close sitting behind the leader, made run for leader in far turn, could not reach rival, kept on then retreated. SHINY COPPER PENNY raced off the pace and
failed to rally into contention. RANGER'S COMING made midrace move, raced off top two leaders, could not keep up pace, faded. KING AGRIPPA lost
ground racing along outside, dropped back.

Footnotes
WHO'S YOUR DRAMA raced along outside while being rated near mid-pack, picked up the pace in the far turn, was put to a drive five wide top stretch,
moved up with striking distance in final furlong, got up late then drifted in couple paths while not fully clear of EL RUSTICO. VIGAS set pressured pace
throughout early stages, cut the corner and took clearer lead upon entering stretch, continued to fight back then lacked final kick nearing wire. BURNING
WILD was unhurried racing near the back, saved ground then altered course to gain clear racing room in final furlong, finished with kick. GINGER GOOSE
(GB) was bit rank while refusing to settle and pulled way up near the lead, eventually settled near three eighths pole, made run for leader, continued within
striking distance in late drive then yielded. DAVE HOEGHT raced off the pace, came under a ride along outside then moved out wider, belatedly.
TURNCOAT raced in range, saved ground along inside into far turn, continued in contention then flattened in lane. BANCO DINERO raced in the back while
placed five wide through the backstretch, roused for response in the lane, failed to move into threatening range. J TO THE CROFT raced in close contention
throughout early stages then failed to move on in the lane. EL RUSTICO was well rated in early stages, moved up in closer contention in far turn, continued
to dig in within striking distance in final furlong, clipped heels with WHO'S YOUR DRAMA approaching the wire, injured and vanned off.

moved off inside and held under driving finish. CHIEF ATTRACTION tracked top two early leaders, roused five wide at head of the lane, finished well
securing place. LAST KISS dueled along outside of eventual winner into stretch, could not match strides with eventual winner, kept on then weakened and
just lasted for show. E Z'S MISTRESS roused for response along outside in turn, continued widest in lane, just missed show, finished well clear over rest.
GRAYCIEZ SPIRIT steadily faded. CALLIE CALIFORNIA no impact.

Footnotes
ADIOS NARDO raced under snug hold to rate off early pace, tapped on shoulder to pick up pace in far turn, shifted to outside, roused five to six wide,
moved forward reaching late leader, dueled nearing wire, got by. CHARLIE MOPS broke to the lead then set pressured pace, continued under pressure
from KATY'S COOPER at quarter pole then shook away to length lead on top, refused to give up when headed by ADIOS NARDO in deep stretch, fought
back til end. FAIR PROSPECT got bumped between rivals at the start, lacked early response trailing in the back, cut the corner entering lane, continued
driving up inside, gained well then yielded in deep stretch. HE'S THE ONE broke out and bumped with rivals at the start, stalked through the backstretch,
angled out at head of lane, roused forward racing in striking distance then evened out in late drive. GENERAL MCGOOBY stalked though the backstretch,
continued up close then drifted wide entering lane, moved in few paths while finishing evenly. JUST FOOLIN AROUND got bumped then slightly steadied
after start, raced off early pace, failed to rally in lane. KATY'S COOPER pressed pace throughout early stages, made run for leader in far turn, could not
reach rival then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S SECRET pressured by OVERDRIVEN CAT for the lead, repelled bids at the quarter pole, came under mild drive, drew off to clear victory,
finished in hand. KIREMBE lacked early speed, hustled up along far outside, was no match for pulling away winner but finished with kick to gain place.
MILBRA loomed up boldly at the quarter pole, was no match for eventual winner, kept on then weakened and lost runner up spot in final strides. FEDERICA
got bumped at the start, continued off pace, responded when asked, gained position then evened out. WALKING PRIMROSE (FR) drifted out and dropped
back after the half mile marker, bore out, continued wide in drive, moved back by some tiring rivals. THAT'S A MYTH chased the early pace, saved ground
along rail entering lane then failed to move on. DEBRAH'S DANCE tracked early pace, roused for more at head of the lane, faded. CAROLINA COURAGE
raced off the pace, failed to rally. OVERDRIVEN CAT applied pace pressure to eventual winner, continued just off rival in far turn, kept on then retreated.
SOFT AND SILENT got bumped at the start, lacked response.

Footnotes
GLORIOUS VENEZUELA sat in tracking just off top two leaders, made move at quarter pole, roused for more, responded and drove by in late drive finishing
clear. SHEZAWAVE was taken back off the pace, quickly gained contending position in the far turn, came out wide for the drive, produced solid finish. BIG
MAMA LADY broke to lead and continued on top under a hold into backstretch, pulled while trying to rate on top, continued to lead the way into lane,
challenged by eventual winner a furlong out, had no kick left in late reserve. KABUKI slightly hopped then got bumped at start, raced off the pace, moved to
far outside and showed good response. QUACK QUACK was allowed to settle in early stages, roused two wide entering lane then flattened out. SAINTE

THERESE raced in range through backstretch, roused along rail in far turn, moved out then dropped back. JILL'S CATCH broke in awkwardly at the start,
raced near the back, then gained position, steadied along rail near three eighths pole then failed to rally in stretch. NEW YORK GEM raced off pace, urged
two path leaving final turn, no impact. MIZZENMYHONEYMOON drifted out wide into lane, no gain. ASIAN MOONLADY raced wide and reserved in first
turn, failed to respond. FEND FOR YOURSELF reared in air at the start then came out six wide in first turn, moved up just off leader, came up empty after
the half. KASSADY LIGHT dropped back after opening quarter, eased up in the lane then walked off after the race.
