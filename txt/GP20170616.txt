Footnotes
NURSE JOHN tossed head at the start then took over lead entering first turn, pulled on top while setting uncontested pace, challenged for lead midway
through far turn, gave rivals the slip then pulled away while ridden out. LA PARCELA tracked pace through the backstretch, roused for more midway through
far turn, could not reach eventual winner, continued steady bid in the lane while gradually drifting out, just lasted for runner up spot. BE SURE LISA was
unhurried and raced in the back, circled around far turn then was set down for the drive, produced good finish, just missed place. BREAK AWAY raced in
range early stages, roused five wide in lane, showed response but needed more for impact. LEGENDOFTHEKITTEN stalked two wide then waited along
inside in far turn, came under a ride but failed to kick on. HARBOR JEDI checked entering then in first turn, raced in bit tight near inside, angled out then hit
traffic top stretch, moved to inside then lacked response. PATRONA picked up pace at midway point, loomed up in close contention in far turn, could not
sustain bid, faded in the lane.

Footnotes
SARAHTHEQUEENBEE moved up after opening stages to challenge FLYING TO STAR for lead, dueled along the outside then took over still racing in
hand, tapped couple times past eighth pole, drew off to easy victory. PIKI PIKI GIRL raced off the top two leaders, roused five wide into lane then came out
wider, was no match for winner, continued to chip away for place, gained position. FLYING TO STAR led the way in opening stages then quickly came
under challenge from eventual winner, dueled along inside, was no match for rival, steadily weakened in lane. YOU CAN DO MAGIC raced off early pace,
roused along far outside, drifted wider, failed to threaten, finished clear over rest. PEACFULWARRIORGIRL raced off the pace, saved ground along inside
in turn, moved out, failed to move on. MISS SUGAR came up empty after half. CALABRIA dropped back after opening quarter. CHARLOTTES DREAM
trailed.

Footnotes
KING'S GHOST was unhurried racing along outside entering backstretch, settled in nicely while rated off early pace, awaited command racing in hand,
picked up pace just past quarter pole then roused forward five wide, continued willingly moving up closer then steadied when ROYAL JEWELRY drifted out
sharply, moved around and edged by without ever using whip. ROYAL JEWELY set the pace through backstretch, challenged for lead midway through far
turn, repelled bids, cut corner still clear on top, came under left handed encouragement, drifted out sharply then drifted out again in late drive. TEMPLE FUR
brushed with rival in first turn then was rated near mid-range through the backstretch, hustled up between rivals at quarter pole, continued with response,
steadied slightly when ROYAL JEWELRY moved back inside in deep stretch. TERI'S BIG HEART raced off the pace, shifted out at head of the lane, moved
out wider, kept on with response. VENDITA pressed early pace, continued close contention in far turn, kept on two to three wide in lane then failed to
sustain bid in late drive. GOLDEN DELICIOUS steadied along rail in first turn then stalked while saving ground, roused along rail in final turn, moved out
then weakened. IMNAHA tossed head at start and came away slowly losing a lot of ground, continued in back, no gain. MORENA MIA prompted early pace,
continued in close range in far turn then failed to move on near quarter pole.

HEART ASTRAY dueled for early lead racing along inside of FIORE, took command racing two wide entering top stretch, tapped couple times in final
furlong, clear. HANSEN'S GIRL raced between rivals lacking racing room, hustled up between foes top stretch, gained and secured place. CELTIC
MOONLIGHT raced in bit tight along rail in early stages, waited for racing room then cut corner, roused forward just off inside then evened out in late drive.
MY THIRD EYE raced up close near lead midway through turn, came out five wide, lost position then continued steady outside bid. FIORE dueled along
outside of eventual winner, was no match leaving turn, kept on then weakened in late drive. CARD SPUN lacked speed, saved ground along rail entering
top stretch, moved out and failed to move on. BELLA KITTENS hit gate came away awkwardly at the start, showed early response then dropped back.

Footnotes
MCFLY raced just off early leader then moved up to apply pressure to rival, came under a ride near quarter pole, was no match for MITOS Y LEYENDAS,
kept on along outside, moved out wider while gaining on aforementioned rival, got by in time. MITOS Y LEYENDAS broke sharp to lead, came under
pressure in turn, repelled MCFLYS bid, raced clear on top then began to drift out, got caught in deep stretch by aforementioned rival. SCAM got bumped
back at the start, moved to outside, raced wide into drive and produced solid finish. ACES FOR JOHN raced bit tight between then waited in turn, roused up
inside in lane, needed more. EXPRESS JET checked sharply along rail leaving backstretch, retreated.

challengers in far turn, repelled bids and took narrow in upper stretch then took on challenge of FEARLESS DRAGON, fought back gamely then lacked final
kick to move on. BRAVE ENRIQUE lagged behind the field in early stages, picked up the pace, drifted out wide upper stretch, straightened out and
continued gaining five wide. GOLDEN KANTHAROS dueled for early lead racing along outside of FLEMISH CAP, took on added challengers in far turn,
continued to battle back, was no match for aforementioned rival entering top stretch, kept up close then gaveway in final furlong. VENCEDOR saved ground

along rail in turn, roused up inside at head of lane, showed response, gained position then evened out. SALUTATION raced up close then inched up and
vied three wide for lead near quarter pole, could not sustain bid, faded in lane. EPIC DRAMA loomed up four wide at quarter pole racing in hand, roused for
more leaving turn, lacked response, dropped back. TAVERNI BAY raced near the back, urged couple paths off inside upper stretch, failed to move on.
