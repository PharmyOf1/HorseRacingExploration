Footnotes
FEARLESS PRINCESS was positioned well racing three to four wide just off early pace, moved up near lead midway through far turn, came under a ride
and reached equal terms with LOOKIN FOR MONEY, dueled along outside then got by and edged away. VERA'S FINALLY was bit keen wanting to go in
backstretch while being rated near inside, steadied slightly along rail mid-way through far turn, angled out at head of the lane and finished strong. LOOKIN
FOR MONEY edged away after opening quarter and held clear lead on top, challenged by FEARLESS PRINCESS in far turn, held the edge then dueled
along inside of eventual winner til deep stretch then lacked needed kick to move on. WHO'S THAT CHICK raced in the last flight on inside, lost some action
and steadied past three eighths pole, cut the corner then produced mild three to four wide. VOW ME OVER edged back after opening stages and remained
well rated through the backstretch, asked and gained closer in far turn then failed to sustain kick, flattened out. RARA tossed head awkwardly at the start,
raced in last flight, hustled up along outside at head of the lane, failed to threaten. ZUBI ZUBI ZU raced up close tracking the pacesetter, urged for response
three furlongs out, failed to move on.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD TOMCAT was keen wanting to go through the backstretch but remained well handled and kept under snug hold, waited at the quarter pole
then guided outside, came under strong hand ride then shown whip, pulled away to easy victory. CUNNINGHAM CREEK was taken back in opening stages,
continued unhurried, ridden up along outside entering top stretch, split foes in final furlong and secured runner up spot. ALY CRUISE was rated racing along
outside of eventual winner, came out entering top stretch then continued steady outside bid through the lane. MISS REGAL LIGHT set the uncontested
pace, challenged for lead at quarter pole, kept on upper stretch then gaveway. GET A ROOM tracked the leader, dueled with rival at quarter pole, kept on
upper stretch then weakened. SILVER SASSY pulled way up in close contention then came up empty after half.

saving ground through the backstretch, took closer order in far turn, roused two wide entering lane, drifted out despite right handed encouragement, brushed
back RED BUTTON, straightened out kept on. ROAD WARRIOR MAX raced along the outside while rated in range, loomed up closer at quarter pole, came
out entering top stretch and continued steady even bid to end. BIG CITY HEART tracked the leader through the backstretch, made move for rival in far turn,
raced near the lead at quarter pole but could not kick on with rival, kept on then gaveway. RED BUTTON stalked the pace, continued in contention then had

Footnotes
DIA DE PAGO sat off top two leaders positioned along inside of GOODY, roused for more entering top stretch, moved inside racing under strong left
handed encouragement, got by WHATACLASSYLADY then finished clear. WHATACLASSYLADDY angled in after start and vied for lead, shook off
EASTER VIGIL mid-turn still in hand, came out three wide top stretch, continued driving on top then lacked needed kick to move on with DIA DE PAGO in
deep stretch. GOODY raced off top two leaders, continued driving five wide, just lasted for show. YEEHAW raced off early speed then produced good
outside finish in lane. ARISTTELES was off slow, trailed the field, moved out wide while under strong left handed encouragement, had mild improve.
EASTER VIGIL was sent hard to gain lead at start, dueled along inside of WHATACLASSYLADY, could not match strides midway through turn, weakened
in lane. KEENEWAY steadied along rail, lost action, dropped back.

Footnotes
TOIKIN edged away on top after initial stages, continued to lead the way into lane, saved ground still under hand ride, put to drive in final furlong ang held
firm. DOMENIC raced near inside then steadied slightly near three eighths pole and moved out, headed in pursuit then was set down along outside upper
stretch and finished strongly to capture place. CRIMSON SPADE chased pace racing just off leader, continued driving in striking range then got caught for
place at wire, just lasted for show. DISCO MAN raced off the pace, hustled up two to three wide in lane, gained and just missed runner up spots. LUV U
LOTS lacked early speed then improved along rail in lane. PRINCE HUGGINS chased the pace into upper stretch then flattened out. RUNNING TRAPPES
got bumped bit by rival and steadied sharply near three eighths pole, kept on in contention then weakened in lane. MISS PADDY raced along outside and
began to drift in, brushed into ROLLIN which caused RUNNING TRAPPEs to steady sharply, retreated. BOY SCOUT was slow at the start, continued in or
near the back. ROLLIN got brushed by drifting in MISS PADDY in backstretch then again near three eighths pole, lost action.
