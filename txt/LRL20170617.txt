BETTER WAY , a forward factor in the two path down the backstretch and on the turn, eased out three wide entering the stretch, gained the lead outside
horses approaching the eighth pole then drove clear. CHAMPAGNE TIME circled the turn three wide, raced on her left lead and rallied mildly outside foes. E
LIZZY saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and had a slight rally. TATTERSAIL rushed up three wide leaving the backstretch, bid for the
lead leaving the turn, dueled outside WISDON OF OZ, weakened and bore in under right hand urging near the sixteenth pole. CHAPEL GAP raced in the
two path on the turn and was no factor. WISDOM OF OZ hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the eighth pole, weakened and was steadied in tight
quarters inside TATTERSAIL near the sixteenth pole. CLOUDS OF TITIAN was outrun. An objection by the rider of WISDON OF OZ against TATTERSAIL
for alleged interference in the stretch drive was not allowed.

Footnotes
MAGICIAN'SQUESTION saved ground setting a pressured pace, sprinted clear in upper stretch then was kept to her business in the drive. NO LOVE LOST
, steadied in close quarters along the rail
leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses through the stretch and rallied.
NATURAL NOTION , four deep leaving the backstretch, circled the turn and lacked the needed rally. RADIANT ELEMENT , between horses around the
turn, steadied in traffic approaching the stretch then weakened. WHENALLELSEFAILS , three wide on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and failed to be a
factor. DO YOU LIKE THAT prompted the pace outside the winner, faltered in mid stretch and drifted out late. NOT ABOVE LOVE was outrun. STEFFELOE
raced in the two path between horses down the backstretch, steadied in tight quarters entering the turn and faltered.

PARTICIPATE stalked the duel down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, secured command in upper stretch and dug in late under brisk urging
to prevail. BEACHES N BOURBON , two wide between horses on the far turn, eased outside in upper stretch and rallied nicely. ZIPPITY GAL saved ground
disputing the pace and weakened through the stretch. APHRODITE'S QUEST , three wide the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, swung out in
upper stretch and passed tired horses. SHE IS SPECIAL saved ground both turns and weakened. MY CITY , three wide the far turn, retreated through the
stretch. LOCKUPTHEBOURBON disputed the pace two wide and faltered. ROYAL LOUISE trailed.

Footnotes
CHEESE ON , patiently handled two wide on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside horses and drove clear.
ONEMOREGREATTIME , four wide on the turn, raced between horses in the stretch, brushed with DA DA DA DUDE in mid stretch and continued gamely.
OLD TIME REVIVAL , two wide on the turn, chased the pace, failed to keep up in mid stretch then finished gamely inside horses. DA DA DA DUDE
stumbled at the break, moved up four wide on the turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch, brushed ONEMOREGREATTIME in mid stretch when racing
greenly and weakened. DIRTYFOOT , fractious in the paddock, bore out at the break, rushed up four deep to take the lead entering the turn, was well in
front into stretch then gave way approaching the eighth pole. STREET COPPER broke awkwardly, hugged the inner rail on the turn, angled out near the
eighth pole and was not a factor. XTRA WISEMANN was a brief factor along the inner rail into the turn. I'MHEREALLDAY was outrun. ZEKE THE STREAK ,
no factor, bore out on the turn.

Footnotes
CAROLINA SHAG prompted the pace outside MAGGIESFREUDDNSLIP, over took that one in upper stretch, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch and
dug in tenaciously under strong riding. CATCHING FIREFLIES , five wide between horses leaving the turn, rallied outside the winner. BROKEN BRIDLE ,
squeezed back leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses in upper stretch, angled outside approaching the sixteenth pole and closed nicely. BIOTERP
chased the pace, was three wide between horses entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally in an even effort. EXCHANGING SECRETS saved
ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and finished willingly. ONE LAST SHOT circled the turn, was six deep entering the stretch and
failed to menace. MAGGIESFREUDDNSLIP set the pace along the rail and gave way the final furlong. ELEGANT SUPERMODEL (GER) , five wide
entering the stretch, was not a factor. OFFICER BUNS saved ground on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. LITTLEFIREFIGHTER raced in the three
path on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
PARADE OF NATIONS stalked the pace behind horses on the turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, secured command outside horses
approaching the eighth pole and drew off under pressure. HILL SHADOW , three wide on the turn, drifted to the four path entering the stretch and rallied
outside foes. BABY CAT lacked speed, raced off the rail into the stretch, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied. EVERYBODYLUVSRUDY , four wide
entering the turn, angled in a bit while dropping back on the turn, raced in the three path in the stretch and offered a late move between rivals.
CONCORDIA'S WAY , bumped by WARLEIGH leaving the starting gate, gained a three deep lead on the turn, raced on his left lead in the drive and
weakened. WARLEIGH came out at the break, dueled two wide inside CONCORDIA'S WAY on the turn, weakened and raced on his left lead in the drive.
AMERICAN ROAD showed speed along the inner rail and gave way leaving the turn. APOLLO LANDING dropped back.

Footnotes
SHIMMERING ASPEN prompted the pace outside CRABCAKES down the backstretch, overtook that one entering the turn, was set down approaching the
eighth pole and steadily increased her advantage while kept under urging. CRABCAKES set a pressured pace along the rail down the backstretch, lost the
lead on the turn, was taken to the three path in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but gamely held the place. FOLLOW NO ONE circled the turn,
was four deep turning for home and had a mild gain outside rivals. YELLOW AGATE , three wide on the turn, was under urging mid way on the bend,
remained on her left lead despite left hand urging through the stretch and weakened. CHINA GROVE raced in the two path on the turn and failed to rally.
ASTROLLINTHEPARK dropped back leaving the backstretch and raced in the two path on the turn. SINE WAVE , angled in early, hugged the inner rail on
the turn and gave way after a half mile.

Footnotes
ZEN'S LAND raced in the two path between horses on the far turn, eased out to the four path in upper stretch, closed outside horses while attempting to lug
in and was up in time. FLYINGTOBECHILDERS prompted the pace outside GREEK GOD, gained the lead mid way down the backstretch, opened a clear
lead on the far turn and gave way grudgingly. HARD DRIVE saved ground on the far turn, was taken to the four path in mid stretch and rallied outside rivals.
SOUP D'COUPE saved ground the first turn, raced in the two path between horses on the far turn, swung to the three path in upper stretch, advanced to
mid stretch then flattened out. JOSE SEA VIEW saved ground on the turns, advanced along the rail to reach contention in mid stretch then weakened.
GREEK GOD showed speed along the rail, drifted to the two path turning for home and gave way. OUTOFTHEDEPTHS , three wide both turns, chased the
pace and gave way. MY GIANT , four deep the far turn, faltered.
