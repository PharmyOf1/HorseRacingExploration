sixteenths and faded late. STILBURNIN bobbled inward at the break and bumped with a rival, pulled his way forward between rivals leaving the five eighths,
angled to the rail to chase around the turn but had no stretch response. FOR THE PROUDNFREE , four wide early, made a mild three wide move nearing
the lane then flattened out in the final furlong. CRAZY WILD BILL , bumped at the start, saved ground chasing early, dropped back when getting out around

Footnotes
LIQUID ALOHA stalked the pace three wide, was under pressure from the far turn, closed in outside rivals nearing mid stretch, took command soon after,
kept on under repeated left handed encouragement and was all out to prevail. IGGY LOCO settled off the pace while four wide, moved up under asking into
the lane, shifted out leaving the eighth pole and finished gamely to just miss. LOST STORY rated in the two path and to the inside of rivals, awaited room
leaving the five sixteenths, steadied near the quarter pole, angled out and regrouped into the lane, closed between rivals leaving the sixteenth pole then
lacked some room at the line. ROCK SOLID GOLFER stalked the pace off the rail, was under a solid ride leaving the far turn, bid between foes in mid
stretch and gave way grudgingly. ALUMINUM STRIKER settled back inside, angled out leaving the far turn, circled six wide into the stretch and continued
willingly. DON'T POKE THE CAT , between rivals through the backstretch run, gained off the inside nearing mid stretch then flattened out. KING OF THE
JUNGLE cleared early and angled in to set the pace, came under a ride into the lane, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths then faded in the
final seventy yards. CHILLY MAGICIAN saved ground and weakened nearing mid stretch. HORSESHOE HARBOUR steadied off heels entering the first
turn, raced off the rail and failed to menace.

challenge approaching the stretch, was guided out further, dueled outside ROL AGAIN QUESTION from the quarter pole, gained a slim lead inside the
furlong grounds and held firm under repeated right handed encouragement. ROL AGAIN QUESTION rated off the leaders four wide, dropped in a bit and
moved in hand to collar LEATHER GOODS from his outside, gained command leaving the three eighths, was hooked by the winner soon after, dueled
inside that one through the final quarter mile and stayed on well. VOO DUDE , in a bit close between foes nearing the turn, regrouped and angled out,
chased four wide into the lane and came up empty. GLORY HOUND lacked speed, angled out nearing the lane and failed to menace. LEATHER GOODS
took command leaving the chute, was pressured from his outside leaving the far turn, ceded command past the three eighths and tired through the final
quarter mile. LOVELY GAMES leaned in at the break, saved ground into the lane and failed to be a factor. FIFTY WEST was pulled up lame leaving the
three quarter pole and was vanned off.

Footnotes
NO KNOCK RAID rated inside, eased out advancing into the lane, was nicely handled working between rivals, surged under pressure and got up in the final
yards. ANIMAL QUIET dueled three wide outside a rival, spurted clear past the eighth pole and kept on gamely. CROWD FUNDING chased the pace three
to four wide, close in steadily past the sixteenth marker, loomed boldly but hung late. MR. BENZ was taken up sharply between rivals nearing the turn,
angled seven wide in upper stretch and rallied. KING GATTO , off slowly after bumping with a rival, lagged back, picked up the pace three wide into the
lane, dove inward leaving the eighth pole then split rivals with a sharp move. SUNRISE SUNSET steadied in close quarters along the rail entering the turn,

recovered to save ground, angled out with some run in upper stretch then lacked some room inside the eighth pole. TRICKY LION rated back early, circled
the turn four wide, made a run in mid stretch then flattened out. MR. MAGICIAN , between rivals early, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a bid.
SPOILED BY GOD dueled inside ANIMAL QUIET from the far turn to about mid stretch then weakened. ZIPPING BY had speed inside rivals, eased back
into the turn, chased along the rail into the lane, kept up pursuit past the eighth pole, came up empty and steadied late. SULTRY ENCOUNTER was
steadied along the rail nearing the turn, angled out and failed to menace. JO WAY JAVA , bumped at the break, raced wide and faded.

Footnotes
HIGH TOLERANCE relaxed nicely four wide stalking the pace, responded when given her cue and forged five wide to command in upper stretch, drifted in
slightly while going clear past the three sixteenths then eagerly widened while kept to solid encouragement. KNUCKLE KNOCK stalked the pace two to
three wide, challenged between runners entering the lane, could not go on with the winner nearing mid stretch but continued with interest. VALUE ADDED ,
in tight at the break, edged up nearing the five eighths, waited a bit mid turn, altered well wide for the drive, switched leads a few times and kept on willingly.
MAJESTIC TRICK bobbled at the break, pulled her way to a stalking spot between rivals after a quarter mile, shifted in under pressure near mid stretch and
faded. EXPECT A KITTEN bobbled at the break, angled out early and settled, commenced a run and followed the winner four wide leaving the half mile
pole, kept on to upper stretch then faded. BRING ME ANSWERS cleared early, set the pace two wide, was collared in upper stretch, gave little resistance
and retreated. CHERISHED PRIZE saved ground off the pace, angled out and failed to respond. FAITH 'N WORKS saved ground, raced in range to upper
stretch, had no kick from there and dropped back.

responded when set down soon after, kicked clear and held firm in course record time. FRISKY MAGICIAN settled in the clear, came under pressure
leaving the far turn, progressed three wide into the lane and kept on with good energy while saving the place. ESPOSITO saved ground, altered out leaving
mid stretch and rallied. NOT A CHANCE broke through the gate pre race, raced between foes early, saved some ground making headway into the lane,
angled but needed more late. JARVIS STEEL vied three wide and in hand through solid fractions, kept up the fight to mid stretch then faded. EASY RIVER ,
off the rail, failed to menace. UNCLE YOUDGE , away alertly, set a pressured pace inside, kept on to about mid stretch then faded. JOCKAMO'S SONG
rated outside rivals early, circled four to five wide into the lane then gave way. JOSEPH broke a step slow and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LOVE YOU MUCH prompted the pace outside QUICKHATCH, overtook that one approaching the stretch then drew off under steady handling. TRUE CAT
bumped TURBO BOOSTER when coming out at the break, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the four path turning for home, rallied outside horses
and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. MAJOR ANTHEM saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch, steadied lacking room in mid stretch
then passed tired horses. GREAT CAPTAIN bumped and forced in TURBO BOOSTER when bearing in leaving the starting gate, raced four wide leaving

the turn, bore in on foes near the eighth pole then bore out on DIAMOND DRIVE inside the eighth pole before weakening in the drive. DIAMOND DRIVE ,
two wide on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, failed to rally and was steadied when forced out a bit by GREAT CAPTAIN inside the eighth
pole. ALLURING SILVER chased the early pace, dropped back leaving the turn, steadied in close quarters in mid stretch then passed tired foes. TURBO
BOOSTER broke to the right, was solidly bumped by GREAT CAPTAIN soon after the break, raced four deep on the turn and was not a factor.
QUICKHATCH sped to the early lead, set the pace near the rail and gave way late. UNCLENEDWHODRANK , a forward factor three wide between horses
on the turn, failed to keep pace and was steadied in close quarters near the eighth pole. SENSATIONAL NOTION , two wide on the turn, steadied in close
quarters inside horses in mid stretch then weakened. ITSNOT COMPLICATED , five wide on the turn, gave way. Following an objection by the rider of
TURBO BOOSTER, GREAT CAPTAIN was disqualified and placed seventh for interference leaving the starting gate. An objection by the rider of TURBO
BOOSTER against TRUE CAT for alleged interference leaving the starting gate was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run
but no action was taken.
