Footnotes
MARS CURIOSITY bobbled after the start but recovered immediately, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the turn,
took the lead at the three-sixteenths, drifted out some under a left-handed whip into the final furlong, dueled with the runner-up in the final sixteenth and
gamely prevailed under strong urging. GUNTHER chased the pace from third, rounded the turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch, made an
outside bid at the furlong marker, dueled with the winner in the final furlong and was denied while clear for the place. SKYLAS GOLD set the pace under
pressure, was urged along against the rail on the turn, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong then weakened
but just held the show. PLASKA settled near the middle of the field, was roused while four wide on the turn, came under the whip outside the furlong marker
and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. YANKEE GAMBLER was forced out at the start then bumped with a rival, raced towards the rear
while urged along, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. MADE ME TALK settled off
the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to outside the sixteenth-pole, altered course to the outside and
failed to threaten. PRINCE BING bumped with a rival after the start, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, lacked room coming to the eighth-pole, shifted to the outside from behind horses and was no factor. VALID DECISION broke out at the start then
was hustled, went three wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. HIYA KID was urged along off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty.

drew clear under steady urging. MY GOLDEN AURA was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, was urged along off the pace, came under
stronger encouragement in the two path on the far turn, shifted four wide while off heels into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the
winner. VALENTINE DAY DEAL brushed with a rival at the start, raced in the two path early on the first turn then dropped to the rail, settled off the pace,
was urged along while four to five wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response but narrowly earned the show. GAME BIRD brushed with a rival at
the start, saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, ranged up in the two path on the far turn, took the lead on the outside at the
quarter-pole, floated three wide into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner, drifted in nearing the furlong marker and tired. BLAME THE CADDIE went
four wide on the first turn, lagged well behind, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. UNIVERSITY PARK was hustled from the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace, vied inside on the far turn, was headed at the
quarter-pole and gave way. POLITICAL WAR went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging late on the

Footnotes
VALEN FOREVER left the gate under some urging, raced in the two path early on the first turn then dropped to the rail, was rated off the pace, started the
far turn in the two path, was asked while shifting to the four path at the five-sixteenths, chased five wide into the stretch, made a bid in the final furlong,
brushed with the runner-up late and prevailed under strong urging. SOUTH TEXAS DRAWL went four wide on the first turn, moved up quickly on the outside
to contest the pace, vied in the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, battled for the lead into the final sixteenth, drifted out at that point,
brushed with the winner late and missed. WELSH WIZARD saved ground on the first turn, contested the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, led
into the final furlong, lost the advantage shortly thereafter and weakened while well clear for the show. NATO ISATEXAN raced in the two path on the first
turn, lingered well back in the field, bumped with IMARAZORCAT at the seven-sixteenths, dropped to the inside entering the turn, saved ground through that
bend, ducked out under a left-handed whip at the top of the stretch, switched to a right-handed whip and came up empty. PLAY FOR JOY was rated in the
three path on the first turn, moved up early on the backstretch, dropped back with a half-mile to run, came up empty in the two path on the far turn and
retreated. INDYGO FULL MOON was taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, came under urging before the five-eighths, came up
empty in the four path on the far turn and stopped. IMARAZORCAT shifted out entering the first turn, went five wide on that bend, settled at the rear,
bumped with NATO ISATEXAN at the seven-sixteenths, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn and faltered then was pulled up at the top

Footnotes
VALID'S FINAL broke out at the start then was hustled, set the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, extended the advantage into upper
stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. COMANCHE HOPPER pressed the pace on the inside, angled three wide at the quarter-pole,
pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. STORMY SPECIAL came out at the start then bumped with a rival, was urged along
on the inside of A REASON TO WIN, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths, rounded the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch under the
whip and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. MISTER BREE was bumped at the start then forced into another rival, raced well off the
pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the whip and was no factor. SONG CAPTAIN was void of speed, went two to three
wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and showed little. GOTTA B QUICK was urged along near the back, traveled around the turn in the two
path, turned into the stretch near the rail while under the whip and was outrun. A REASON TO WIN was bumped at the start and forced out, chased the
pace, went three wide on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
WITT SEVEN saved ground on the first turn, was well placed near the inside, went two then three wide on the far turn, rallied into upper stretch, closed
strongly to get the lead near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under a strong hand ride. SURE THING SHEILA went three wide on the first turn, tracked
the pace, took the lead at the three-eighths then moved clear in the two path on the far turn, dropped to the rail turning into the stretch, drifted in passing the
chute and was overtaken while clear for the place. JOYOUS EVELYN went around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, raced four wide
while urged along on the far turn and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. AFTERIMAGE went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace,
moved closer late on the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn, moved to the two path turning into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong
and tired. GIO POINT settled on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, moved to the two path near the quarter-pole, swung four wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. WINGS OF SILVER went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn

and came up empty. GLITTER BRIGHT went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was taken up early on the far turn, went three wide
on that bend, steadied behind horses at the furlong marker and was no factor. MULA STALKER went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the inside
of a rival, rounded the far turn in the two path, steadied behind horses at the furlong marker and never reached contention. REJOICE AN BE GLAD was
taken up a tad early, went four to five wide on the turns and failed to respond. DYNA ON A MISSION went four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed
down the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the far turn and tired. DIMES FROM HEAVEN traveled around the first turn in the two path, set the
pace, was headed at the three-eighths, came up empty while inside on the far turn and stopped.
