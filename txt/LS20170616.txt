Footnotes
OUR VALOR brushed with a rival at the start, quickly sped clear, dictated terms in the two to three path through the turn, responded well when put to a
right-handed whip at the furlong marker, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride late while much the best.
RUNNER LOOSE was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide early on the turn, moved to the four path near the quarter-pole, came five wide
into the stretch and finished with good energy to just get the place. SACRED HEART LADY was ridden along at the back on the outside, went four then five
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and finished well to just miss the place. WHATACLASSYLADY brushed with an opponent at the start, was
urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. FLATTER UP chased the pace, raced inside to the two path on
the turn and weakened. LOUISE'S LEGACY tossed her head at the start and was last away, raced off the pace under urging, was taken up inside the
three-eighths, moved from the rail to the two path around the quarter-pole, was put to the whip at the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. ARIA (MEX)
chased the pace, went two to three wide on the turn and tired. KIT KAT CODE was ridden along on the outside, went three wide on the turn and was no
factor. CUSTOM FOR CHLOE brushed with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
SHE'SASWEET DEPUTY broke awkwardly but with the field, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, took the lead outside the
furlong marker, disposed of MUFFALETTA outside the sixteenth-pole and held off the runner-up under strong urging. SWEETNORTHERN ROSE tracked
the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the eighth-pole, chased the winner in the final furlong, gained on that foe late and just missed while
well clear for the place. MUFFALETTA showed good speed, set the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, came under a
drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and weakened while clear for the show. DAISY N PARADISE was urged along at the
rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, passed the quarter-pole under the whip, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FIVE
SISTERS broke out at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along while three to four wide on the turn and failed to respond.

under strong urging. EXPECT ROYAL chased the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, made a bid between horses at the quarter-pole, battled gamely in

Footnotes
LINGERLONGER went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn, came under the whip at the
three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong, made a bid at the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. DANCE CHAMPION went to the
front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, set the pace with a sizable advantage, raced inside to the two path on the far turn, came under a drive in
upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was denied. KING PTOLEMY traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was urged
along while two to three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished willingly to get the show. ISH RULES settled on the inside, was
urged along on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out some near the sixteenth-pole and also finished willingly but just missed the
show. CHRISTMAS CABALLO went around the first turn in the two path, followed the solo leader, chased two to three wide on the far turn and lacked the
needed kick. DIRTY STEVE went three wide on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and lacked the needed
response. MENDING FENCES went four then three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn and failed
to rally. THE FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE UNVAILABLE BECAUSE THE GATE WAS SET AT THE WRONG LOCATION AND THE RACE WAS RUN AT A
SHORTER DISTANCE THEN THE MILE LISTED, THE DISTANCE WAS SWITCHED TO ABOUT A MILE AND A HAND TIME FROM GATE OPENING
WAS COLLECTED IN 134.25

Footnotes
VESTED VENTURE set the pace under some pressure, drew off in the two path on the turn, widened under a drive into the final furlong then was eased up
while much the best. APRIL SUGAR broke a step slow, moved up then came under urging, was put to stronger encouragement in the three path on the turn
and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. CLEARLY BEST settled off the pace, was urged along while inside early on the turn, shifted
three wide outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SONGS SUNG BLUE broke a step slow then came out and
clipped heels, settled towards the rear, was urged along while two then three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. EARLY BUCKFINDER was well placed
just off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn and faltered. GILS DRUM was taken under a strong hold early then reserved off the pace, came
under urging while three to four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond. LAVENDER RIDGE stalked the pace on the
outside, was asked at the seven-sixteenths, dropped back in the two path on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
UNREAL DEAL rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace in hand, controlled the action while inside on the far turn, responded well when set down
in upper stretch and proved best under a strong hand ride. LODI STREET saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while two then
three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished well for the place. FRED'S LUCKY BOY brushed with a rival after the start, was in
tight between horses early, settled off the pace, moved closer while four then five wide on the far turn, chased the winner into upper stretch and lacked the
needed kick while able to get the show. GRASS COURT saved ground on the first turn, was well placed down the backstretch, came under urging in the two
path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. PANTHER CREEK was rank while inside through the first turn then reserved off the pace, traveled
around the far turn in the two path, was roused at the three-sixteenths and also lacked the needed response. MULA JOHN lugged out four wide while rank
into the first turn, dropped to the two path midway through that bend, settled towards the back, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SALTY SONG was carried five wide into the first turn, dropped to the three path midway through that
bend, settled near the back, was urged along while inside on the far turn and failed to rally. SINGING EAGLE went three to four wide on the first turn, settled
on the outside, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn and came up empty. SINGING ACES went three wide on the first turn, tracked the
pace on the outside, chased two then three wide on the far turn and tired. MERTZIES PRIDE traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved
near the middle of the field, came under urging while three wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond.
