Footnotes
LORD TOCCET rounded the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the far turn, made a bid outside the
quarter-pole, took the lead at the top of the stretch and proved best under strong urging. BIM BAM traveled around the first turn in the two path, was
reserved off the pace, came under urging while three wide on the far turn, chased the winner in the drive and finished willingly for the place. POLKA JOKE
set the pace on the inside, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead at the top of the stretch, battled determinedly in the drive and just lost the place.
EARLY RIDE went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, chased the vanguard in the drive and
was out-kicked then just missed the trifecta. PICEANCE jumped in the early going, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in
the two path on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and was outfinished. CUCO TREJO saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, raced
behind horses into the final furlong, was roused outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. PREACHER PREACHER rounded the first turn in
the two path, settled near the back, was urged along in the four path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch under the whip, held a good striking
position into the final furlong but lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
MISS KATNISS veered in at the start and was off a step slow, rushed up towards the inside, took the lead outside the half-mile pole, extended the
advantage into upper stretch and drew off under a solid hand ride to prove much the best. ROUNDABOUT RUBY bumped twice with a rival at the start,
showed good early speed, lost the lead outside the half-mile pole, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner into upper stretch, drifted out
near the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. WIND HOPPER chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on
the turn and tired while best of the rest. SUGAR BE SURE bumped twice with an opponent at the start, chased the early pace, dropped back coming to the
half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip and came up empty. SNORING SUZZZZ broke about four lengths slow,
drifted out early, settled on the outside, was urged along in the five path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond.

Footnotes
KISSTHATBABYGOODBY contested the pace on the inside of MALIBU CHARLIE, vied inside on the turn, dueled with the aforementioned opponent in the
stretch, led gamely into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. REFLECTOR was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn,
came four wide into the stretch, took an awkward stride outside the sixteenth-pole and finished fast to just miss. MALIBU CHARLIE contested the pace on
the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, dueled with the winner into the final sixteenth and missed while able to
hold the show. MY VALIDATION chased the leading duo from third, rounded the turn in the two path, pursued the dueling leaders in the stretch, gained on
those foes late and steadied nearing the wire then missed the trifecta. BAD HUMOR was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and finished willingly. IMA DINGDONG DADDY was urged along towards the back, hesitated off heels leaving the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and finished well then was taken in hand behind horses at the wire. SHOW BOUND
was urged along towards the back, went four then five wide on the turn and gained late but failed to seriously threaten. EURONCALL dropped back while
urged along, went three then four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. CONTRAPUNTO (MEX) lacked early speed, lugged out a bit leaving
the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
MR ARK was urged along off the pace, came between horses at the half-mile pole, advanced two then three wide on the turn, moved out from behind the
leading duo in upper stretch, rallied to the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under strong urging. BOSTON MARATHONER was forwardly
placed on the outside, made a bid at the three-eighths, vied three wide on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and
was outfinished while able to secure the place. LIAM'S SPEED was urged along off the pace, advanced three then four wide on the turn, made a bid at the
top of the stretch, battled into the final sixteenth then weakened while able to hold the show. PHARME'S SOUL raced well back in the field, went two then
three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. UNBROKEN SONG was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two
path, turned into the stretch in the three path and failed to rally. BOGEY tossed his head near the three-quarter pole, settled off the pace, was urged along
while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. DEACON'S HERO pressed the pace on the
outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back at the quarter-pole and tired. THE RIGHT FRIEND broke out at the start then ducked in, moved to
the lead, set the pace under pressure, vied along the rail on the turn and gave way. BEER BELLY was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back while inside
to the two path on the turn and retreated. NEKO NATION was fractious in the gate, broke a bit awkwardly then brushed with a rival, went three wide on the
turn and was no factor. BIG GATOR brushed with a foe at the start, came out early on the backstretch, fell well behind in the four path on the turn, came five

wide into the stretch and faltered.

from the four to the six path on the turn, chased the winner into the final

Footnotes
POKER TABLE quickly sped clear, lugged out from the three path to the five path on the turn, responded well in the stretch and held under steady urging.
BIG PEPS chased the pace, was carried out
furlong, bumped with
PRINCEOFFIVESIDES nearing the wire and finished willingly to get the place. PRINCEOFFIVESIDES broke a step slow, was ridden along at the rear,
moved closer while five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong, bumped with BIG PEPS nearing the wire and just missed
the place. PRIMARY JUDGE bumped with a rival at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, chased under a drive in the
stretch and lacked the needed kick. SIR PAPA JOHN was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and
improved position but missed the superfecta. SHEZADOLL bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on
the turn, chased under a drive in the stretch and also lacked the needed kick. NO GUTS NO GLORY bumped with an opponent at the start, checked while
very rank behind horses from the half-mile pole to inside the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, steadied while lacking
room behind horses in the final sixteenth and lost all chance in a brutal trip. SCORPIAN JACK was urged along off the pace, raced inside on the turn, drifted
in passing the chute and came up empty. PERFECT RATE was urged along towards the front, traveled around the turn in the two path, made a bid near the
quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened.
