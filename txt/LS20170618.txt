Footnotes
ALL BEHROOZED UP was urged along off the pace, advanced four wide on the turn, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, battled gamely in the stretch and
narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BIG BEAR RYAN disputed the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, battled gamely in the stretch, fought between
horses late and just missed. I'M HIGHLY RATED was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, rallied in upper stretch, closed well to
make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with the top two to the wire and just missed. STERLING APPEAL dropped back while urged along, traveled
around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive and finished willingly. COLOUR MY WORLD pressed the pace on
the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, battled into the final furlong then weakened. BETA PHONE was taken up slightly early, went four wide on the
turn and was no factor. WATCH OUT contested the pace on the inside, dropped back at the three-eighths, chased inside on the turn and tired.
HOLDMYGOLDBACK lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and was no factor. MANCO drifted in after
breaking last, moved out towards the rear, went four then three wide on the turn and showed little.
