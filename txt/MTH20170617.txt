Footnotes
TRUE ROMANCE stumbled at the start, quickly recovered to set the pace on the inside, responded when challenged in the stretch and dug in gamely inside
for the win. SHE'S ALL READY chased inside, rallied two wide into the stretch, dug in gamely but came up second best. APRIL GAZE raced off the pace
inside, moved up three wide on the turn and rallied mildly outside. MY COUNTRY stalked two wide and weakened. LITTLE CHERIE steadied at the start,
raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and did not factor. EVERYTHING MAGIC raced off the rail and did not factor.
