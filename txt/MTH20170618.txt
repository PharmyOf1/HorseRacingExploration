WILL raced three wide entering the first turn, then moved over to the rail, tracked inside, angled out passing the quarter pole, closed steadily outside of
FAIRBANKS E JET and was up late for the win. FAIRBANKS E JET set the pace on the inside, edged away to a clear lead, drifted out wide in upper stretch,
dug in gamely and yielded grudgingly near the finish. SOCIAL NETWORK pressed the pace in the two path, chased on the far turn, came three wide into
the lane, angled in at the eighth pole and finished evenly. FAKE FRONTIER raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, came four
wide into the lane and lacked a rally. JAMES ALEX was off slowly and outrun early, moved up on the rail around the far turn and gained some ground
inside. MY UNCLE SAM raced off the pace inside and did not factor. GONE ASTRAY KISS raced four wide early, then chased three wide and gave way.

Footnotes
TIMELINE bobbled slightly at the break, then set the pace on the inside, responded when asked in upper stretch, pulled away to a comfortable lead and was
ridden out. TALK LOGISTICS was in a bit tight along the rail on the first turn, moved up inside to track the pace, slipped off the rail at the quarter pole, rallied
two wide into the stretch, dug in gamely but was clearly second best. HONOR THE FLEET pulled three wide early, then stalked two wide, was asked on the
far turn, weakened and just held on to earn the show. GLORY STARS raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, continued on the rail, lacked a rally
and just missed for third. GREEK PRINCE was in a bit tight in the early stages, steadied at the five furlong marker, then settled two wide off the pace and
tired.
