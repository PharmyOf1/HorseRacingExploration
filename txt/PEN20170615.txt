Footnotes
AQUAPHOBIA settled outside in the three path, began a rally into the far turn, vied outside the leaders into the final furlong and was going away at the end.
STAR CONTENDER stalked two wide outside the early leader, took over in early stretch but couldn't contain the winner. SUGAR BUZZ was content to lag,
saved ground into the stretch while rallying, angled to the outside and finished fastest. HOLIDAY TOUCH wasn't far back along the inside, came out in the
lane but lacked the needed closing. CALL FIRST was hustled to the front, remained in comment along the inside into the stretch then weakened.
BOWMAN'S BEAST was unhurried inside, moved closer into the stretch but couldn't gain in the lane. RAGING MARKET was outrun. HIRSCHBEIN faded
inside. WINNING SHOT stopped.

Footnotes
BRIANS A SMARTY was never far back outside, advanced four wide on the turn, took over entering the final furlong and held after a stiff drive. OLIMPICO
showed speed between horses, drew out on the turn then was outfinished in a game try. TIME TRACKER was bumped after the break, raced two wide
between horses around the turn and gained slowly through the lane. SMARTER THAN US was bumped into TIME TRACKER leaving the gate, swung wide
into the stretch and lacked a closing. NICKY C hesitated in the gate at the break then found best stride too late. WRESTLER made the early pace inside
then stopped. MAGNUM FORTY ducked out into SMARTER THAN US leaving the gate then was outrun. THORNADO (IRE) showed speed outside into the
turn then stopped in the lane.
