Footnotes
PEA DIDDLE prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, drew on even terms for the lead, matched strides the balance of the trip and proved best under
strong handling. ADALZARA sprinted to the lead soon after the start set the pace into the stretch, dug in determinedly but just missed hanging on. HOT
FLASH saved ground and closed a gap late. I GOT THE TIME failed to menace. CLASSY CAMELIA was no factor. SHIP AHOY with the second flight,
between horses, gave way in the stretch. PASSAGE WEST with the second flight three wide, was through after a half.

Footnotes
EKATI'S ICE unhurried early, responded readily when set down three wide engaging the leaders on the far turn, was carried out by the leader entering the
stretch, battled the balance of the trip and got up in time. COINCIDENTALLY allowed to settle, moved up steadily in the four path, made the lead on the far
turn, drifted entering the stretch, set the balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. TOP OF THE WORLD pressed the early pace two wide, made the
lead on the backstretch, set the pace into the far turn then finished grudgingly along the rail. WILLY SMILE failed to menace. CONEY ISLAND KID was no
threat. MASTER MICK set the early pace and was through after a half. DR. NEFARIO bobbled at the start, was in tight between horses briefly then was no

Footnotes
SPECIAL OF COURSE dueled for the early lead two wide, edged clear before the turn, turned back a strong bid from SHOW RIVER midway on the turn, set
the balance of the pace and proved best under strong handling. WHERESTHEPRENUPT unhurried early, closed determinedly three wide in the five path
through the stretch and got up for second. SHOW RIVER had speed from the start, loomed boldly three wide on the turn, battled with the winner into the
stretch then was outfinished. JILLY FROM JERSEY found her best stride late four wide. POMERA offered a mild bid in the four path on the turn then came
up empty. FIRST HEART BREAK closed up for three furlongs faded. HI FEVER dueled for the early lead inside, had speed into the turn then gave way.
MULTIFLORA was no factor. PROVOCATIVE KISS was outrun. ZENZELDA hopped at the start then trailed.
