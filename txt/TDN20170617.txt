wide and closed some ground late in the middle of the racetrack. NOTIONAL KING also swung wide and passed tiring rivals late. KIKI'S WAR had speed

on the turn, set the pace into the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. RIVERY HALL was no threat. DAPPER TAPPER dueled for the early lead along

MASQUERADE PARTY broke in front, dueled for the lead three wide into the turn, dropped back some then came on again determinedly in the five path to
make the lead in deep stretch and drew clear. I'M IN A HURRY bore in at the start bumping I'M CARDINAL, sprinted up to rail to dispute the pace nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, battled the balance of the trip then couldn't handle the winner. WHERE'S WOODY found his best stride late in the six path. YO
BERBS dueled for the lead between horses into the stretch then weakened late. SHIROTA offered a mild bid in the five path entering the stretch then
leveled off. MANOFMANYVIRTUES inside, was no threat. I'M CARDINAL was bumped at the start then outrun. TEPU WAR had speed into the turn then
faltered.

MR LIGHTNING BOY allowed to settle, closed quickly two wide on the turn, put a head in front nearing the quarter pole, drew clear and won under mild
urging. GOT GRIT offered a bid in the four path entering the stretch and finished clearly second best. OFFLEE SINISTER went evenly. MASCHERATO
failed to menace. MAJOR DRAMA chased the pace from the four path into the turn, loomed boldly nearing the quarter pole then came up empty.
LUCKYSDREAM sprinted to the lead leaving the chute, set a rapid pace for a half then wilted. TIZ ERINS NIGHT offered little.

Footnotes
SUPER STAN chased the pace into the stretch, rallied two wide to make the lead near the furlong marker and drew clear under brisk handling in the five
path. ASTRO JAK never far back, rallied late in the six path and got up for second. OSCEOLA POND sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the
pace until mid stretch then was outfinished. CHARLEES FINEST passed tiring rivals. DOOR OF HOPE had brief speed. RICKLES had speed into the turn
then faded. LEOTA DOUBLE E was outrun. DEPUTY DANE failed to menace. THANK YOU FOR ME stopped on the turn, was eased in upper stretch,
jogged to the wire and returned bleeding bilaterally from the nostrils.
